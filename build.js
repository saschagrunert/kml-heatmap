// Size budgets in bytes, each for the minified files as written (raw) and

// prints each size next to its budget, so every CI job that builds the
// bundles enforces them. Raise one on purpose, in the change that needs the
// room, and say what it paid for in the commit message.
//
// The policy: an app bundle gets about 2 KB of raw and 1 KB of gzipped room
// over its size when the budget is set, a vendored file about 1 %. The
// gzipped budget catches what the raw one rewards the wrong way: a change
// that saves raw bytes by making the code harder to compress. Two pull
// requests that each fit can still not fit together, since each is built
// against the main branch of its day; the budget is checked again on main.
//
// The gzipped sizes depend on the zlib that Node.js was built with, not on
// the Node.js version, and CI's differs from a local build's by up to about
// 0.5 %, larger for the big files: MapLibre 6.10.0 is 312,146 B gzipped in
// CI and 310,925 B on a NixOS machine (0.4 %), the first visit 0.4 % more
// (48.64 KB against 48.45 KB). CI is what enforces the budgets, so size a
// raise by the sizes CI prints (the "Build the JavaScript bundle" step of
// any job), not by a local build.
//
// The comment of each budget says what it covers and how large that was
// when the budget was last set. Every earlier raise and lowering, with what
// it paid for and the sizes it was set by, is in the history of its line:
// `git log -L '/^const BUDGET_APP/,+1:build.js'`, or the same for any other
// budget.
//
// The stylesheet has a budget of its own, in tests/test_asset_budget.py: it is
// minified by the Python side, not here.

// What a first visit downloads: the app and the chunk it shares with the
// lazy bundles, which the page loads together (mapApp.bundle.js only starts
// the chunk, so the sum is what counts). What the map draws cannot move to a
// lazy bundle, since a link may open turned, as a globe or in 3D; what only
// a panel or a mode shows can. About 52.6 KB gzipped in CI when it was last
// set, raised for the safe area of the home screen app (the popups and the
// start view clear of the status bar, the island and the home indicator).
// Raised for share mode on top of the replay of a day and the search
// (159.35 KB and 54.22 KB gzipped in a local build after): the selection
// it holds still, its chip, the flights a filter hides and a tap told from
// a click. Raised by 256 B raw (161.67 KB and 54.99 KB gzipped in a local
// build after) for the airports that a failed airports.json leaves out,
// said over flights whenever they come and loaded again once per Retry,
// and an export that waits for the heat sources, less long before the
// share sheet. Raised again, by 0.75 KB raw and 0.25 KB gzipped (162.22 KB
// and 55.17 KB gzipped in a local build after), for the intro of a link to
// shared flights: the mark Copy link puts on such a link, taken off the
// address bar as the page opens, the fetch of the intro, which lives in
// the feature bundle, and the listening for input from the page open on,
// as the intro is not to play over a view the visitor moved while the
// data and the bundle were on their way. Raised by 0.75 KB raw and 0.75 KB
// gzipped (163 KB and 55.49 KB gzipped in a local build after, the
// gzipped budget about 1.4 % over that for CI's zlib) for the heat and the base
// map's labels that dim across the aviation chart's band of zooms in their
// paint, through a pinch, and the export that waits for the map within one
// deadline from the tap to the share sheet. Lowered by 7.5 KB raw and 2 KB
// gzipped (153.65 KB and 52.91 KB gzipped in a local build after) as the
// sheet of the phone's bar and the export moved to the extras bundle and
// each icon's paths became one. Raised by 10.25 KB raw and 4 KB gzipped
// for the airport codes that glide round their dots to where there is room
// (calculations/codePlacement.ts, ui/airportLabels.ts), clear of the other
// markers' squares, placed again as panels come and go, the room they take
// on the map as large on a tilted map, and drawn there as pins, by their
