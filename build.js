// Size budgets in bytes, each for the minified files as written (raw) and
// for the same files gzipped at level 9 (gzip, see measure()), which is
// closer to what a visit downloads. Every production build checks them and
// prints each size next to its budget, so every CI job that builds the
// bundles enforces them. Raise one on purpose, in the change that needs the
// room, and say what it paid for in the commit message.
//
// The policy: an app bundle gets about 2 KB of raw and 1 KB of gzipped room
// over its size when the budget is set, a vendored file about 1 %. The
// gzipped budget catches what the raw one rewards the wrong way: a change
// that saves raw bytes by making the code harder to compress. Two pull
// requests that each fit can still not fit together, since each is built
// against the main branch of its day; the budget is checked again on main.
//
// The gzipped sizes depend on the zlib that Node.js was built with, not on
// the Node.js version, and CI's differs from a local build's by up to about
// 0.5 %, larger for the big files: MapLibre 6.10.0 is 312,146 B gzipped in
// CI and 310,925 B on a NixOS machine (0.4 %), the first visit 0.4 % more
// (48.64 KB against 48.45 KB). CI is what enforces the budgets, so size a
// raise by the sizes CI prints (the "Build the JavaScript bundle" step of
// any job), not by a local build.
//
// The comment of each budget says what it covers and how large that was
// when the budget was last set. Every earlier raise and lowering, with what
// it paid for and the sizes it was set by, is in the history of its line:
// `git log -L '/^const BUDGET_APP/,+1:build.js'`, or the same for any other
// budget.
//
// The stylesheet has a budget of its own, in tests/test_asset_budget.py: it is
// minified by the Python side, not here.

// What a first visit downloads: the app and the chunk it shares with the
// lazy bundles, which the page loads together (mapApp.bundle.js only starts
// the chunk, so the sum is what counts). What the map draws cannot move to a
// lazy bundle, since a link may open turned, as a globe or in 3D; what only
// a panel or a mode shows can. About 52.6 KB gzipped in CI when it was last
// set, raised for the safe area of the home screen app (the popups and the
