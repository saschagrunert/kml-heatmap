"""The wire format of the exported segment rows.

A year file is by far the largest thing the page downloads, and it used to
be plain JSON floats: about 41 bytes for every row of
``[lat, lon, altitude_ft, groundspeed_knots, time?]``. Three properties of
the data make that wasteful. Every value is already rounded to a fixed
number of decimals by the exporter, so it is an integer in disguise;
consecutive rows are contiguous and slow-moving, so the difference between
neighbours is far smaller than the value itself; and those differences
repeat within a column (a steady climb, a constant speed) far more than
across one.

Encoding therefore scales each column to an integer, stores the difference
to the previous row, and writes a path column by column rather than row by
row, which puts the repeating differences next to each other for gzip. The
format is lossless for the values the exporter produces: every column is
scaled by exactly the step it was rounded to, so
``decode_rows(encode_start(start), encode_rows(start, rows)) == rows``,
which ``tests/test_segment_codec.py`` checks over generated data.

Format 4 adds the ground under every row (see ``kml_heatmap.terrain``), in
feet, as a column of its own beside the others: ``encode_ground``. A path
whose ground is not known has none, and the page falls back to the line
between its airfields.

``kml_heatmap/frontend/services/yearDecode.ts`` mirrors ``decode_rows`` and
``decode_ground``; the year file carries ``FORMAT_VERSION`` so the two cannot
be mismatched silently.
