"""The ground under the flights, sampled from an elevation model at build time.

The 3D view of the page draws every flight at its height above the ground.
Without an elevation model the ground of a flight can only be a line from
the field it left to the one it landed on, which knows nothing of the hills
in between: a flight across a ridge sits too high or too low over it, the
more so the lower it was. The exporter therefore samples the ground under
every exported position here and writes it next to the altitude (the ground
column of ``segment_codec``), so the page reads it and computes nothing.

The elevations come from the Terrarium tiles of the AWS open data terrain
tiles (Mapzen's Joerd, from SRTM and other sources), fetched once and kept in
the cache directory. The page never loads a tile: the ground reaches it as
numbers in the year files.

A digital elevation model and the altitudes a recorder logs never agree to
the foot: GPS altitudes are off by tens of feet, a barometric one by the
pressure of the day. The ground is therefore anchored where the flight
itself shows where it is: at the field it left and the one it landed on,
the altitudes it recorded taxiing there are the ground (see
``ground_profile_ft``), and in between the model is shifted from the one
offset to the other in proportion to the distance flown. A flight taxis on
the map at both ends, and follows the relief in between.

Nothing here fails a build unless asked to: a tile that cannot be fetched
or decoded leaves the positions under it without ground, and a path with a
position without ground gets no ground column at all, so the page falls back
to the line between the fields for it. A build that publishes the site sets
``KML_HEATMAP_REQUIRE_TERRAIN=1``, which fails it instead (see
``sample_path_elevations``).

The tiles are fetched by ``terrain_fetch`` and their pixels kept decoded
by ``terrain_pixels``; this module samples the ground from them.
