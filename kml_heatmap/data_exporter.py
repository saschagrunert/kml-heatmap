"""Data export functionality for flight heatmaps.

Exports flight data to JSON files for the browser frontend:
- <year>/data.json: per-year path info and segments
- airports.json: deduplicated airport locations
- metadata.json: years, year file sizes, the groundspeed range and the aircraft
  models

The frontend computes every flight statistic from the year files, so the
export keeps no statistics of its own beyond the groundspeed range.

The work is split into chunks that run in parallel: a year with many paths is
cut into several chunks so that the export scales with the number of CPU
cores even when there are only one or two years. Each worker writes its share
of the year file as JSON fragments and returns its counts and groundspeed
range instead of the segments themselves; the main process concatenates the
fragments into the year file without parsing them.

Path ids are derived from the path content (see ``path_content``) in the
main process, before the work is chunked. They end up in shared links and in
the saved state of the frontend, so a re-export has to keep the id of every
flight that is still there, whatever was added or removed around it. Within a
year file the paths keep the input order.

The files are written into the staging directories of a ``SiteOutput`` (see
``site_output``), which publishes them all at once.
