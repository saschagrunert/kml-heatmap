"""Link previews: an image of the site, of each year and of each flight.

A link shared in a chat or a post unfolds from the Open Graph tags of the
page it points to. Scrapers run no JavaScript and ignore the query string,
so ``?y=2025&p=...`` cannot bring an image of its own: every year and every
flight gets a small page of its own instead (``y/2025.html``,
``f/<id>.html``), which carries its tags and sends a browser on to the map
with a meta refresh. The map's CSP allows no inline script and no
``<base>``, and a stub has no script at all. The paths are flat, so a
flight that leaves the input takes its page and its image with it (see
``PREVIEW_FILE_PATTERNS`` and ``SiteOutput``).

``og:image`` takes an absolute URL, and nothing in the build knows where
the site is published: the images are only drawn, and named in the tags,
when the site's URL is given (``--site-url`` or ``SITE_URL_ENV``). The
stubs are written either way.

The images are drawn with the standard library alone: the tracks as a glow
weighted by the time spent on them, on the page's background, in the
colours of the heat cloud of the 3D view (``CLOUD_COLOUR`` in
ui/heatCloudShaders.ts), written as a palette PNG. They carry no text, no
date and no build stamp, and only exported flights are drawn. The same
tracks always give the same bytes, so an image is cached under a hash of
what it draws and of this module (see ``PreviewJob.key``).
