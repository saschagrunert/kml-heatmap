# === Groundspeed Calculations ===
# Above this a groundspeed is a position or clock glitch rather than a
# measurement: faster than any piston or turboprop aircraft with a good
# tailwind, and than most light jets. Such a speed counts as unknown.
MAX_GROUNDSPEED_KNOTS = 600
MIN_SEGMENT_TIME_SECONDS = 0.1  # Avoid division by very small time differences
SPEED_WINDOW_SECONDS = 120  # 2 minute rolling average window for speed calculation

# === Timestamps ===
# How far a timestamp may be from the median of its track before it counts
# as a clock error. Generous for a flight, which is over within a day, and
# even for a logger left running for days; far below the errors it catches
# (a clock at its default date, a GPS week rollover of almost 20 years). The
# parser drops such a stamp, and the obfuscator moves it on its own.
MAX_TIMESTAMP_DISTANCE_SECONDS = 7 * 24 * 3600

# === Altitude Gain ===
# A climb counts toward the altitude gain of a path only once the altitude has
# risen this far above the lowest point since the last descent, and a descent
# ends it only once the altitude has fallen this far below the highest point.
# GPS and barometric altitudes wander by a few meters from fix to fix; summing
# every small rise would turn a level cruise into thousands of feet of climb.

# === Mid-Flight Detection ===
# Heights are above the field elevation when the airport database knows it
# (see airports.reference_altitude), above sea level otherwise

MID_FLIGHT_MAX_VARIATION_M = 100  # Maximum altitude variation for stable flight
