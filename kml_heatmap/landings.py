"""Landings, touch-and-goes, go-arounds and the runways they used.

The page only sees altitudes in steps of 20 ft and cannot tell a touchdown
from a pass a few dozen feet up, so the flights are read here, at build
time, from the parsed track with its full precision and its timestamps.
Each exported flight gets four counts in its path info (see
``export_pipeline.build_path_info``): full-stop ``landings``,
``touch_and_goes``, ``go_arounds`` (a low approach looks the same at GPS
precision, so both count as one) and the ``touchdowns`` as a list of
``[airport, runway]``. Nothing of it carries a time.

The rules, per timed fix of a flight:

- A field is the nearest airport of the database (one with a runway, so
  no heliport) within ``FIELD_RADIUS_KM``. Its ground is the elevation the
  database gives plus the logger's offset: how far the altitudes the
  logger recorded while taxiing at known fields are above their published
  elevations, the median over the whole flight. A GPS altitude is off by
  tens of feet, a barometric one by the pressure of the day, and the taxi
  altitudes at a single field can be off by far more (a receiver that has
  not settled yet), which the median over the flight evens out.
- The aircraft is airborne once its groundspeed passes ``TAKEOFF_KNOTS``
  and it is ``TAKEOFF_CLIMB_FT`` above the field ``TAKEOFF_CHECK_SECONDS``
  later.
- A touchdown only counts once the aircraft has climbed ``ARMED_CLIMB_FT``
  above its takeoff (or its last touch-and-go): otherwise every takeoff
  roll would read as a touch-and-go.
- Within ``CONTACT_FT`` of the field's ground at ``CONTACT_KNOTS`` or more
  is a touchdown. Below ``STOP_KNOTS``, still within ``CONTACT_FT`` of the
  ground, it is a full-stop landing; a climb of ``CLIMB_AWAY_FT`` without
  stopping makes it a touch-and-go. The height matters for the stop as
  well: a gap in the timestamps reads as a stop wherever it is. Within
  means above or below: a logger that loses its altitude for a while
  reports the aircraft hundreds of feet under the ground.
- Below ``APPROACH_FT`` above a field without coming within ``CONTACT_FT``
  of it, then a climb of ``CLIMB_AWAY_FT``, is a go-around when the track
  to the lowest point lines up with a runway of the field (any track at a
  field without runways in the list). No new approach starts before the
  aircraft is above ``APPROACH_FT`` or away from the field again, so the
  climb away counts once.
- The runway is the track over the last ``APPROACH_SECONDS`` before the
  touchdown, snapped to the nearest runway end of the field in the
  OurAirports runway list (``airport_lookup.load_runway_database``). A
  constant magnetic variation would only hold in one part of the world;
  the true headings of the runway list hold everywhere.

The detection runs with the parse of every file, in the parse workers
(see ``path_landings``), and the parse cache keeps what it found with the
paths: its key covers the airport and the runway database. The export
only falls back to detecting them itself (``detect_landings``) for paths
that come without them; its workers never load the databases.
