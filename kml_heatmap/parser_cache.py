"""KML parse result caching.

Cache files are keyed by the content and name of the KML file, the cache
format version, a fingerprint of the parser code and a fingerprint of the
airport database, so any change invalidates the entry. The content rather
than the modification time is hashed so that entries survive git checkouts
and CI clones; hashing costs little next to parsing. The name is part of the
key because the parse result carries it (and the aircraft taken from it). The
airport database is part of the key because the parser standardizes airport
names with it: a file parsed while the database was unavailable would
otherwise keep its raw names until the KML changed.

An entry is the parse as compact JSON, compressed with zstd: a few million
points take a fifth of the space, and the files are read back faster than
the JSON alone is from disk.

Stale entries are not removed on the fly. ``prune_stale_cache_entries`` does
that in one pass over the cache directory before a run: entries that another
parser, format version or airport database wrote can never be read again,
and any other entry goes once it has not been used for ``CACHE_MAX_AGE_DAYS``.
