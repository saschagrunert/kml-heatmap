"""Initialization and sizing of process pool workers.

Python 3.14 starts workers with the ``forkserver`` method, so the parent's
logging configuration is not inherited. The initializer restores the log
level (debug, the default or --quiet). The export workers never look up an
airport and do not get the airport database; the parse workers get the one
the parent loaded, which takes a tenth of the time of reading the CSV again
in every worker. ``--jobs`` caps every pool (see ``configure_workers``).
