 * is the row's END point: consecutive rows are contiguous, so the start of a
 * row is the end of the one before it.
 *
 * Every column holds integers scaled to the step the exporter rounded to,
 * stored as differences to the row before (the start point seeds the two
 * coordinate columns). A path without a time column carries no relative
 * times, and a null in it marks a row without one; the running time then
 * stays where the last row that had one left it.
 *
 * A value that is not a finite number would turn into a NaN coordinate,
 * which the map cannot draw. Since every value is a difference, nothing after
 * it can be trusted either, so the path is cut short there with a warning
 * instead, and left out when that is its first row.
