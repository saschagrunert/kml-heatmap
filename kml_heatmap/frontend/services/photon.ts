/**
 * The geocoder the search of places asks for any place on earth: Photon of
 * komoot (https://photon.komoot.io), over the data of OpenStreetMap. It
 * needs no key, and asks in return that its free service is used fairly: no
 * request for every keystroke, and no request it has answered before. So
 * the search (ui/locationSearch.ts) asks only after a pause in the typing
 * or on Enter, and from a few characters on (PLACE_MIN_LENGTH), drops a
 * request the next one replaces, and this client keeps the answers to the
 * last CACHE_SIZE texts for as long as the page is open, so none of them is
 * asked twice.
 *
 * What it sends is the text the visitor typed, and nothing else the page
 * knows: no position of the map to rank by, no cookie (`credentials:
 * "omit"`) and no address of the page (`referrerPolicy: "no-referrer"`).
 * The browser still says which site asks (the Origin of a cross-origin
 * request), and Photon sees the visitor's address, as every server does
 * (see doc/privacy.md).
