/**
 * The content of the heat sources, written as GeoJSON text by the year
 * worker (services/yearWorker.ts).
 *
 * The heatmap draws a point per fix, 135,000 of them for all years of the
 * sample flights (116,000 with those of one pixel merged, see mergedPoints).
 * Handed to MapLibre as objects, a feature each, they cost the main thread
 * about 120 ms on a desktop (in Chrome: 70 ms for MapLibre's own copy of
 * them and 45 ms for the structured clone to its worker) and three to
 * four times that with the CPU slowed down as for a phone, on every change of
 * the year, the aircraft or the weighing, on top of the objects themselves and
 * the exposure (see doc/development/heat.md). A source that is given a URL
 * instead is loaded, parsed and cut into tiles by MapLibre's worker alone (two
 * fixes of scripts/vendor.js see to that: without them MapLibre fetches a Blob
 * URL on the main thread, and sends back what it parsed). So the page packs the
 * heat into one column of numbers (heatColumns), the worker works out how it is
 * drawn and writes the text into a Blob, and the page gives the source a URL of
 * that Blob.
 *
 * The text is the one JSON.stringify writes for the same features, with the
 * coordinates of the heat points to 5 decimals (about 1.1 m, drawn up to
 * zoom 12.75), those of the heat lines to 7 (about 1 cm, drawn up to the
 * map's last zoom) and the heat of the points to 4 significant digits. The
 * heat lines the heatmap hands over to take the same way, packed by
 * flatLines.
 *
 * Like everything else in yearWorker.bundle.js this is no part of what a
 * first visit downloads. The packing runs on the page, from the same bundle
 * (services/yearDecoder.ts), which also writes the text there when the
 * worker cannot be used.
