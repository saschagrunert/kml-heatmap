 *
 * A browser may remember a failed import for as long as the page is open
 * and answer every later import() of that URL with the same failure,
 * without asking the server again. A retry therefore names the file under a
 * URL the page has not tried yet. The first attempt is the caller's own: the
 * build resolves its literal specifier (to a lazy bundle, which shares its
 * modules with the app through shared.bundle.js, or to a vendored module)
 * and leaves the computed one of a retry alone. Every bundle sits next to
 * this one, so `file` resolves the same from whichever holds this module.
 * A file named with a query (see `versioned`) is imported by that name on
 * the first attempt as well.
 * @param first - The first attempt, an import() with a literal specifier
 * @param file - What the build names the file, relative to the bundles
 * @param failedImports - Imports that were rejected before this one

 * the query. Versioning shared.bundle.js as well would give the page a
 * second copy of the app's modules, each with its own state, so the app
 * compares the build a lazy bundle exports with its own instead (see
