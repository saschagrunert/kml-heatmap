 * Altitude: plasma, sampled between 0.15 and 0.75 of the ramp.
 *
 * A rainbow was the obvious ramp and the wrong one. Its lightness is not
 * monotone, so equal steps in altitude read as unequal jumps, and its
 * green-yellow-red half is exactly where red-green colour blindness
 * collapses. Plasma rises steadily in lightness from end to end, which also
 * means an exported image survives being printed in grey.
 *
 * Plasma rather than viridis because of where the flying sits: a light
 * aircraft spends nearly all of its time between about 2,000 and 5,000 ft of
 * a scale that runs to ten thousand, and viridis crosses that band as
 * teal into green, which barely travels. Plasma crosses it as magenta into
 * orange, so two flights a thousand feet apart are two colours.
