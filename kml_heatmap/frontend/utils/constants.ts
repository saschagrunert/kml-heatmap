/**
 * How the heat source merges the fixes when the map is zoomed out. The
 * worker does it (supercluster): up to `maxZoom` a tile holds clusters, each
 * at the centre of its fixes and carrying their number as `point_count`,
 * which the heat layer takes as the weight. Closer in it holds the fixes.
 *
 * The intensity of a point halves with every level zoomed out (see
 * heatmapIntensity in the data manager), and MapLibre adds the points up in
 * a half-float texture. Below about 0.004 a single point's share underflows
 * there and the whole heatmap vanishes, which with every fix drawn happens
 * under zoom 9. So the fixes are drawn as they are from zoom 9 on, and
 * `maxZoom` is the level below.
 *
 * A cluster gathers the fixes within `radius` pixels of its first one, so
 * along a track the clusters are about `radius` apart at a whole zoom and
 * just under twice that before the next level takes over, where the map
 * still draws the tiles of the level below, scaled up. At 6 that is 6 to
 * 12 px, well inside the 22 px a point reaches, and a lone track stays an
 * even line. At 12 it already shows as a string of beads, and at the reach
 * of a point the tracks fall apart into blobs.
 *
 * The share of a cluster cannot underflow. A pixel of the map at zoom z is
 * 40075 km * cos(latitude) / (512 * 2^z), which at 51 degrees north and
 * zoom 12 is 12 m. The fixes of a track are about 235 m apart, so 6 px of it
 * hold 6 * 12 * 2^(12 - z) / 235 = 0.31 * 2^(12 - z) fixes, while a point
 * weighs 0.0375 / 2^(12 - z). The zoom cancels: a cluster of a lone track
 * weighs about 0.0115 at every zoom, and where flights overlap it weighs
 * more. That holds for fixes as close as a flight logger writes them. A
 * fix without a neighbour in reach stays a point of its own, which is why
 * the weight of the heat layer has a floor (see heatmapWeight in the data
 * manager).
