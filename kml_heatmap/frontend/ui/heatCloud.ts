/**
 * The heat cloud - the heatmap of the 3D view, in the air
 *
 * While the 3D view is on, the heat is drawn as a cloud of the fixes at
 * their height instead of as the flat heatmap on the ground, so the busy
 * airspace glows where it is: the circuits over a field, the routes along a
 * valley, the climbs out and the descents in. It shows what the heatmap
 * would: the fixes of the flights the year and aircraft filters keep, of
 * the selection alone while it is isolated, nothing while the Heatmap
 * switch is off; and it steps back under the aviation chart or a
 * selection's lines as the heatmap does, but not under the ribbons of a
 * colour layer, which are drawn in front of it (dimsHeatCloud). While a
 * replay runs it stays, faintly and without its pulses, its marks showing
 * the way flown instead, so the chase camera flies through the flights of
 * before. The replay of all flights draws it at full strength instead, as
 * far as its clock has come into every flight (replayAllTime), so the heat
 * builds up behind the flights and ends as the whole of it; on the flat
 * map as well, at its height as the flights are there, where it stands in
 * for the heatmap, whose colours it glows in, until the replay closes.
 * Left on the ground, it lay beside the trails by their height and read
 * as other flights than theirs. The intro of a link to shared flights
 * (ui/shareIntro.ts) builds it up the same way behind the flights it draws
 * one after another, by the clock of its own player (growHeatCloud), and
 * on the flat map hands it over to the heatmap as Wrapped's cloud does
 * (see sync). The flat heatmap
 * steps aside for it (heatCloud in the store, see
 * ui/layerVisibility.ts) from the moment the cloud's layer is on the map
 * until the 3D view is turned off,
 * or, where the cloud's shaders do not work, until the map has a new WebGL
 * context, which leaves the heatmap as it was meanwhile.
 *
 * The heights are the ribbons', on the same ground and as exaggerated (see
 * calculations/heatCloud.ts), and the layer (ui/heatCloudLayer.ts) is
 * drawn against the relief. It only draws: the map cannot tell what is
 * under the pointer in a custom layer, and the ribbons of the colour
 * layers stay what is hovered and clicked. It comes with the feature
 * bundle, with the relief, the first time the 3D view is on.
 *
 * Wrapped's intro flies over the cloud with the 3D view off
 * (forcedHeatCloud in the store). There the cloud stands on flat ground, as
 * on the globe the intro turns on, and is cut for the level of the zoom the
 * map last came to rest at, which the layer manager only follows in the 3D
 * view, and closer in than the last relief level for that zoom's own
 * level. It is the year of the cards: the flights the year and aircraft
 * filters keep, whatever the Heatmap switch, an isolated selection or a
 * colour layer say, at full strength. It pulses as in the 3D view, woken by
 * the flight and resting when the map does: the replay of all flights that
 * plays under the intro is no replay of the app's (replayActive), which
 * would dim it.
