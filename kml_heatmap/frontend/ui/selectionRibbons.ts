/**
 * Selection ribbons - the lines of a selection at their height in 3D
 *
 * With no colour layer on, the selected flights are drawn as thin lines
 * over the heatmap (ui/selectionHighlight.ts). The 3D view draws the heat
 * as a cloud at the heights of the flights (ui/heatCloud.ts), and the lines
 * flat on the ground lay beside it: at map zoom 9 and a tilt of 60 degrees
 * the glow of a flight at 1,900 ft stood well off its line. While the 3D
 * view lifts the flights, the selection is drawn as ribbons instead, cut as
 * the colour layers' are (calculations/ribbons.ts) from the curves of the
 * flights on their ground (groundedFlights), which the cloud is drawn
 * along as well, so the two lie on each other. To the relief's code they
 * are ribbons like the others (RIBBON_SOURCES): they take the exaggeration
 * of a new relief level in the frame the relief does, and hide with the
 * others while they settle on new ground (ui/terrain.ts). The flat lines
 * step aside for them (selectionRibbons in the store). Like the lines they
 * only draw, and are worked out only while they show (highlightsSelection).
 * They come with the feature bundle, with the relief.
