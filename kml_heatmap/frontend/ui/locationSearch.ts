/**
 * The search of places: a field over the map that finds the site's own
 * airports as the visitor types, and any other place on earth through
 * Photon (services/photon.ts), and takes the map there.
 *
 * It opens from the Search button at the top of the left column, from the
 * Search row of the phone's More sheet and with `/` (see followSearchKey
 * in ui/lazyBundles.ts), and comes with a bundle of its own (search.ts):
 * the first visit carries the button and the key alone. On a wide screen
 * the panel stands beside the button; on a phone it spans the top of the
 * map.
 *
 * The field is a combobox (the ARIA pattern of the same name): the list of
 * what was found is its listbox, the arrow keys move through it while the
 * focus stays in the field (aria-activedescendant), Enter takes the option
 * the keys are on, or the first one, and Escape closes the panel. The
 * site's airports come first, matched on the page at every keystroke
 * (calculations/airportSearch.ts); the places of Photon after them, asked
 * for after a pause in the typing (PLACE_DEBOUNCE_MS) or at once on Enter
 * when nothing is listed yet, and only from PLACE_MIN_LENGTH characters
 * on. A request the next one replaces is aborted, and the client keeps
 * the answers to the last few dozen texts for the page's lifetime:
 * Photon's free service asks for that. Offline, or when Photon fails or
 * takes too long (PLACE_TIMEOUT_MS), the panel says so in a line of its
 * own and the airports are still found. The credit Photon and
 * OpenStreetMap ask for is the panel's last line.
 *
 * An airport that is picked is flown to, and its popup opens as a click on
 * its marker opens it, but without the selection of its flights such a
 * click makes: the search only moves the map. Focus goes to the marker, so
 * Escape closes the popup and leaves the keyboard there. Where the marker
 * is not shown (the Airports switch off, or the filter leaves it out) and
 * for a place, a pulse marks the spot instead, until the next pick or
 * Escape. The camera keeps its bearing and tilt, takes the panels over the
 * map into account (mapChromePadding) and jumps rather than flies under
 * reduced motion.
 *
 * A replay, the replay of all flights, the hotspot tour and Wrapped hold
 * the map, and a search would move it under them: their holds take the
 * button (ui/heldControls.ts), the app ignores the key meanwhile
 * (MapApp.toggleSearch), and a panel or a pulse that is open as one of them
 * starts goes away, with a popup that was still to open at the end of
 * the flight there.
