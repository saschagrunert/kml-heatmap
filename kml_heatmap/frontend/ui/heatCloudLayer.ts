/**
 * The layer that draws the heat of the 3D view as a cloud in the air (see
 * ui/heatCloud.ts): a MapLibre custom layer with shaders of its own, since
 * no style layer draws a glow at a height. Every stretch between two
 * points of the cloud (calculations/heatCloud.ts) is a quad on the screen
 * around its two ends, and each of its pixels gets the heat of the
 * stretch spread along it and blurred across it: a Gaussian of the
 * distance to the stretch, integrated along it from the join with the
 * stretch before to the join with the one after. The joins are the
 * bisectors of the bends, so the stretches of a flight add up to the blur
 * of the whole line without a gap or a bead where one ends and the next
 * begins (round ends overlapped into beads, see the heat lines in
 * mapLayers.ts), and a stretch shorter than its blur is a soft point.
 *
 * The blur is as wide on the screen at the middle of the map at every zoom out
 * to a region, and narrows closer in (CLOUD_STOPS); it is wider in front of the
 * middle and narrower behind it in a tilted view, like everything else there.
 * The heat of a stretch is the seconds spent on it over the pixels it spans, so
 * a lone flight glows alike at every zoom out to a region and at every depth,
 * as the heatmap's intensity keeps a lone track alike by zoom (see
 * heatmapIntensity), and a slow one, a circuit or the taxiing, glows brighter.
 * The glows are added up over what the map has drawn (see CLOUD_COLOUR), so
 * where flights overlap the cloud glows brighter, from blue over cyan to white.
 *
 * It is drawn as a 3D layer, before the ribbons (see ui/heatCloud.ts): against
 * the relief in the depth buffer, so a mountain in front of a flight hides its
 * glow, but without writing to it, so the glow of one flight does not hide
 * another's, and the ribbons are drawn over it. Each glow is pulled towards the
 * camera by its reach for that test, and near the ground as far as the ground
 * in front of it rises, so a fix on the ground glows round rather than cut in
 * half by the ground in front of it. MapLibre's own projection code (the
 * prelude it hands a custom layer) projects the points, which makes the same
 * shaders work on the globe; the points are given from an origin near them, so
 * a 32-bit float keeps them to a fraction of a pixel close in.
 *
 * Three things help to read it. A faint copy of the glow on the ground under
 * the flights, its shadow, shows how high they were. Pulses run along every
 * track the way it was flown, by the time of its points, which shows the
 * direction of a circuit and the usual ways in and out; they rest while the map
 * is not used and under reduced motion, and the map draws no frame for them
 * then, and an exported image has none. Faint marks along the tracks, pointing
 * the way they were flown, take over from them whenever they do not run (see
 * CLOUD_MARK_SPACING_PX), so the direction still shows under reduced motion, on
 * a map at rest, in an exported image and in the cloud of a replay, faint or
 * building up behind the replay of all flights. And the exposure follows the
 * heat: the busiest cells of the cloud glow no brighter than white, however
 * many flights the filters keep (see cloudExposure). A band of heights above
 * ground can leave out the heat below and above it, in the glow and its shadow
 * alike, fading out at its edges (calculations/heightBand.ts); the exposure
 * stays that of all of it, so a band draws its heat as bright as the whole
 * cloud does.
 *
 * The constants named here and the shaders are in ui/heatCloudShaders.ts.
