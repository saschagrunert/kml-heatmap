/**
 * Wrapped's intro - the camera flies in over the year before the cards
 *
 * Opened from its button, Wrapped starts on the globe, far out, with the
 * map filling the dialog under a light shade and the title of the first
 * card over it (wrapped.css), which is what shows while the tiles of the
 * globe come in. The shade and the title lift as the camera flies towards
 * the home base, tilting on the way down and turning slowly once there,
 * while every flight of the overview plays underneath at a few hundred
 * times its speed and at a larger size, so the year blooms out of home
 * (ReplayAllPlayer, ui/replayAll.ts). It comes down only a couple of zoom
 * levels closer than the overview (HOME), where the shape of the whole
 * year shows around home. Then it settles on the overview Wrapped has
 * always shown, the flights stop, and the cards come in one after another
 * as the map draws back into its panel beside them, or, stacked, fades
 * from over them (see settle). About ten seconds, paced so that each step
 * can be taken in: the title stays for two seconds of the flight before it
 * lifts (wrapped.css), and the cards come in slowly enough to read. It was
 * six, where the title was gone within a second of the globe showing.
 * Skip, or a touch of the map, ends it at once with Wrapped as it opens
 * without it: not under reduced motion, nor when the heat cloud's code
 * does not arrive in time (INTRO_WAIT_MS).
 *
 * The cloud is drawn without switching the 3D view on (forcedHeatCloud),
 * over the globe; both go as the intro ends, however it ends, and the map
 * beside the cards shows the flat heatmap, which MapLibre draws anew at
 * every zoom of a flight to a destination. Neither reaches the link or the
 * saved state, which keep the user's switches while Wrapped holds the
 * user's view (StateManager.saveMapState).
 *
 * The flight and the turn carry REPLAY_CAMERA_MOVE, so what the app does
 * as the map comes to rest waits for the settle, which does not: the
 * ribbons of the 3D view, the relief level of the cloud, the saved view.
 * They are the moves of ui/cameraScript.ts, which the hotspot tour makes
 * too, from the feature bundle the intro waits for anyway.
