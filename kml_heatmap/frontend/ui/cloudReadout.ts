/**
 * The readout of the heat cloud under the pointer - how much time was
 * spent there, by how many flights, and at what height
 *
 * While the 3D view draws the heat cloud, resting the pointer on it (or a
 * tap on it) shows a small box beside the pointer: "About 42 min within
 * 1 km" over "17 flights · mostly 800 to 1,200 ft AGL". It says what the
 * cloud there is made of: the flights the cloud draws (the filters,
 * Share mode), along the line of sight through the pointer (see
 * calculations/cloudReadout.ts). It speaks of time, never of the
 * brightness, which the exposure of the cloud scales, and of no date or
 * hour.
 *
 * With a colour layer on, the 3D view draws the flights as ribbons, which
 * run all over a busy field: over a ribbon the values of its
 * segment show as well (ui/pathHover.ts), and the box goes where it leaves
 * them in sight, on the other side of the pointer or beside them. It steps
 * aside over a marker, while the map is dragged or turned, and after
 * Escape until the pointer moves on. A tap or a click on a marker or an
 * airport's code is theirs. One on the map, a flight included (which a
 * mouse selects, and a tap opens its values), shows the readout by it,
 * above a finger, and reads it out once to a screen reader, unless it
 * selected a flight, which the app reads out. A hover is not
 * read out, which would speak at every move. The box takes no pointer
 * events, so the map under it keeps its hover, clicks and drags.
 *
 * The pointer's frames do little: a move of a few pixels keeps what was
 * worked out (READOUT_SLACK_PX), nothing is worked out while the map moves,
 * and what a readout at a zoom is worked out from (the seconds, heights and
 * grid of calculations/cloudReadout.ts) is made once the page has a moment
 * after the map comes to rest, ahead of the pointer. A hover that finds it
 * missing waits for it; a click or a tap, which wants its answer, makes it.
 *
 * Nothing of it runs while the 3D view is off, the cloud is not drawn or
 * the hotspot tour holds the map: the map's pointer events are only
 * listened to while it is, and what it keeps (the seconds, heights and
 * grids of a dataset) goes with the 3D view. It comes with the feature
 * bundle, with the cloud (see ui/heatCloud.ts). The flat heatmap has no
 * readout: its code would have to come with the first visit, or this
 * bundle with every one.
