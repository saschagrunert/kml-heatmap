/**
 * The layer of the replay of all flights (ui/replayAll.ts): every flight as
 * a bright head with a trail that fades behind it, drawn with shaders of
 * its own, as the heat cloud is (ui/heatCloudLayer.ts), since moving a
 * hundred markers and writing a hundred trails to a source every frame is
 * far too slow. The curves of all flights are uploaded once, each point
 * with the seconds into its flight (calculations/replayAll.ts), and a
 * frame only tells the shaders the time: a stretch between two points
 * that has not begun is not drawn, one that has is drawn as far as the
 * time has come, and fades by how long ago each of its pixels was flown.
 * The heads are drawn from the same stretches, one at the tip of the
 * stretch each flight is on.
 *
 * It projects with MapLibre's own code, as the cloud does, so it works on
 * the globe, at the heights of the ribbons and the cloud, and against the
 * relief in the depth buffer without writing to it.
