/**
 * Replay of all flights: every flight the filters keep starts from its own
 * first fix at once and plays at a hundred to a thousand times its speed,
 * each a bright head with a trail fading behind it at its height, so the
 * year blooms out of the home field, in the colours of the colour layer
 * that is on as it opens, if one is. The only clock is the one each flight
 * carries (see calculations/flightClock.ts): the panel reads "0:42 into
 * every flight", and its slider moves along the same clock, never a date
 * or an hour.
 *
 * ReplayAllPlayer (ui/replayAllPlayer.ts) plays and draws
 * (ui/replayAllLayer.ts), and nothing else:
 * Wrapped's intro plays it under its own camera. ReplayAllControls is the
 * "Replay all" control and its panel: it runs the player as a replay of the
 * map (replayActive), which hides the heatmap and the colour layers and
 * holds the selection, the filters and Wrapped as the replay of one flight
 * does, fits the camera to the flights north up, tilted as the 3D view
 * tilts it, and turns it slowly round them on request. The heat builds up
 * behind the flights instead of the heatmap, as far as the clock has come
 * (see replayAllTime) and at the height of the flights, unless the
 * Heatmap switch is off.
 *
 * A selection of several flights plays one after another in the replay of
 * one flight (ui/replayManager.ts), not here.
