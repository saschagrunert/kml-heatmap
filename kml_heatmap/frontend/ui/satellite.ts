/**
 * Satellite - imagery under the flights
 *
 * The Satellite switch (satelliteVisible) lays Sentinel-2 imagery over the
 * ground of the base map, below its roads, borders and labels, so place
 * names stay: a hybrid view. It comes with the feature bundle, which the
 * switch fetches the first time it is on (ui/layerVisibility.ts): most
 * visits never turn it on.
 *
 * The tiles are EOX's Sentinel-2 cloudless mosaic of 2024, keyless like the
 * rest of the page and licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, which this non-commercial
 * site meets; the credit is on the source, so the map shows it exactly
 * while the imagery is drawn, and an exported image carries it. The browser
 * fetches them only while the switch is on.
