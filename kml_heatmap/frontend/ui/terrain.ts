/**
 * Terrain - the relief under the 3D view
 *
 * The 3D view draws the relief and stands the flights on it, at every
 * zoom, exaggerated as much as they are (calculations/lift.ts). The layer
 * manager decides when, and for which level (terrainActive, reliefLevel),
 * in the task it cuts the ribbons on their ground; this module makes the
 * map follow. The globe only shades the relief (reliefShaded) and leaves
 * the relief itself out, whose mesh MapLibre 6.10 breaks the ribbons up
 * on. It comes with the feature bundle: most visits never turn the 3D
 * view on.
 *
 * The elevation tiles are AWS's Terrarium tiles, the ones the build samples
 * the ground from (kml_heatmap/terrain.py), so the relief and the ground
 * the flights are measured against are the same model, smoothed as the
 * map draws it at each level. The browser fetches them only while the
 * relief is drawn or shaded, and the map shows their credit only then.
