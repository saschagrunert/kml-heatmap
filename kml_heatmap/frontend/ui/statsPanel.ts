/**
 * The part of the statistics panel that is there from the first paint.
 *
 * The panel's content and the figures in it are a lazily loaded part of the
 * Wrapped bundle (ui/statsManager.ts, calculations/panelStats.ts): most
 * visits never open the panel, and it is too large to ship with the map.
 * The rail, its triggers and the `statsPanelVisible` key stay in the app
 * (see MapApp.setupStatsRail), so it opens at once; this fetches the bundle
 * the first time it does and starts the stats manager, which follows the
 * store from then on. Until the bundle is in, the panel says it is loading.
 * When it cannot be fetched the app says so (see MapApp.loadStats) and the
 * rail closes again, so opening it once more tries again.
