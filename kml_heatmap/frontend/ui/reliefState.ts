/**
 * Relief state - what the layer manager and the relief's code share
 *
 * The layer manager decides whether the 3D view draws the relief and for
 * which level (LayerManager.syncTerrain), and cuts the ribbons for it;
 * ui/terrain.ts makes the map follow, and hides the ribbons while they
 * settle on their new ground. What passes between the two is kept here
 * rather than on either of them: the relief's switches in the store,
 * written in the order the map needs them, the visit of a level the
 * ribbons are cut in, whether they show, and the sources that hold them.
 * It comes with the app: the relief's code comes with the feature bundle,
 * and the layer manager cuts ribbons before it has arrived.
