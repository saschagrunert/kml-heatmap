/**
 * State restore - the view a link or the last visit left, put back at start

 * MapApp.initialize runs `restoreState` first of all, before the map and
 * the managers exist: the state manager reads the saved state (the link's,
 * or the one kept in the browser, see ui/stateManager.ts), and the year,
 * the aircraft, the selection, the layers and how the map is drawn go into
 * the store in one batch, so the first load already draws what the visitor
 * had. The camera is not the store's: MapApp.setupMap opens the map on the
 * saved view. The panels reopen once there is data for them (see
 * MapApp.initialize), which is why RESTORED_TOGGLES leaves them out.
 *
 * `applyPendingFilterChanges` is the other end of the first load: the year
 * and aircraft dropdowns can be changed while it runs, which the bound
 * handlers ignore until then, and it applies what they show once it is
 * over.
