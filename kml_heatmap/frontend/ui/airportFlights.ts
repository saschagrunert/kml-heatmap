/**
 * The flights of an airport, listed in its popup.
 *
 * A click on a path is the only other way to select a single flight, and a
 * keyboard cannot click a path, so without this list replay, which plays
 * the selected flights, was out of a keyboard's reach. A row picks its
 * flight alone, and its checkbox adds it to the selection or takes it out:
 * that is how flights of the airport join a selection made already, or the
 * flights of share mode (see PathSelection.pickFromList). Each flight is
 * named by its route, aircraft and year only: a date or a time of day
 * would say when somebody flew.
 *
 * AirportManager adds it whenever the popup is open with new content (see
 * listPopupFlights), and lays the popup out again afterwards. The runways
 * the flights of the filter touched down on go above it, with their share.
 * It is part of the app rather than of the feature bundle: fetching that
 * bundle, and its stylesheet, for the first popup cost far more than the
 * list itself.
