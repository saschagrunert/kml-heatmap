/**
 * Layer Manager - Handles altitude/airspeed path rendering and legend updates
 *
 * Rendering strategy:
 * - Each mode draws from two GeoJSON sources that exist from the start (see
 *   mapLayers.ts): the main one with every flight, and a small one for the
 *   selection, whose layer lies on top. This module only ever calls
 *   `setData` on them and sets paint properties and a filter.
 * - Consecutive, contiguous segments of the same path whose value falls in
 *   the same one of COLOR_BINS steps of the colour range are merged into ONE
 *   LineString feature, in the colour of the middle of its step. Merging by
 *   the rounded value instead made tens of thousands of lines out of a
 *   groundspeed that never sits still, for colours no eye tells apart. The
 *   colour is computed here and carried as a property, so the map and the
 *   legend cannot disagree.
 * - A run table per source remembers which segments of the dataset each
 *   feature stands for, which lets the tooltip show the exact data of the
 *   segment nearest to the cursor (`findNearestSegment`). MapLibre simplifies the geometry per tile; the
 *   heatmap, the replay and the statistics read the full data anyway.
 * - A selection rebuilds only the selection's source, whose runs follow the
 *   selection's colour range. The main source stays as it is: its layer is
 *   dimmed with one paint property and filtered to leave the selected
 *   flights (in share mode: everything) out.
 * - In the 3D view (calculations/lift.ts) each run is written as a ribbon
 *   at its height instead of its line, at every zoom, to a source of
 *   ribbons of its own. The ribbon climbs and descends with the flight, in
 *   pieces of one height each, and every piece is a feature of the same
 *   run, so the run table, the selection and the tooltip serve all of them
 *   as they do the line. Its width is part of its geometry, so the ribbons
 *   are written again as the map zooms to another whole level, cut for the
 *   pixels of that level (see screenCut), and from CULL_FROM_ZOOM on only
 *   those around the view, again as the view leaves that. A mode that
 *   is hidden (the replay hides them without clearing them) is left as it
 *   is until it is drawn again.
 * - Paths are pixels of a layer and have no events of their own: what is
 *   under the pointer, for a click and for the tooltip, is found in
 *   ui/pathHover.ts, among the layers and runs this module has drawn.
 *
 * This module keeps the state of the modes and decides what is written
 * when: as the data, the filters, the selection or the visibility change,
 * as the 3D view and its relief come and go, and as a zoom or a pan ends.
 * What it does that with lives next to it: the modes, their state and the
 * cut into runs (ui/pathRuns.ts), the look of a selection, the colour
 * ranges and the legends (ui/pathLook.ts), and the cut of the ribbons of
 * the 3D view (ui/pathRibbons.ts), which comes with the feature bundle.
