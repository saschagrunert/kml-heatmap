/**
 * The hotspot tour: a short flight over the busiest places of the heat,
 * a way into the 3D view that explains itself.
 *
 * It finds the places where the heat the map shows is strongest
 * (calculations/hotspots.ts: the filters and Isolate count, and the heat
 * is weighed as for the heatmap), turns the 3D view and the heatmap on,
 * and flies to each in turn, tilted, turning slowly over it while a
 * caption names the place and the time spent there. Pause, the
 * previous and the next place and Stop are in its panel; Escape stops it
 * too. The 3D view is turned on as the switch of the store, not by its
 * control, which turns the altitude colours on for a map without a layer
 * of the flights: the heatmap is on here, and the cloud is what is looked
 * at.
 *
 * How it ends decides where the user is left. Played to the end, stopped
 * or Escaped, it flies back to the view it started from with the switches
 * as they were: it was a look round, and the user's view, the link and
 * the saved state are what they had. A press, a wheel or a key on the map
 * ends it where it is instead, in the 3D view: the user has taken the map
 * over there, which is what the tour is the way into. Until then the state
 * manager saves the view the tour started from (tourView in the store), as
 * it saves the one Wrapped holds.
 *
 * Under reduced motion nothing flies or turns: the camera cuts to each
 * place, and the tour stays there until the user steps on, with nothing to
 * pause.
 *
 * It holds the filters, the weighing switches, the selection and the
 * features that would take the map (Replay, Replay all, Wrapped, the
 * cross-section, which it closes) while it runs, as the replay does, and
 * none of those starts it. On a phone the bar steps aside while it runs,
 * as it does for a replay, and the panel takes the bottom edge. The
 * readout of the cloud under the pointer hides meanwhile (features.css):
 * the camera moves under a pointer resting on the map.
