 * neither, and the places flown over so often that the density is cut off

 *
 * leaflet.heat drew every point as a translucent disc, and discs painted

 * a little warmer than one, not fifty times as hot. The map adds densities
 * up instead, so on an even scale one track is nearly invisible next to the
 * places flown over every week. The stops therefore sit closer together the
 * lower they are: most are four times the one before, so a single
 * track is blue, a busy route cyan, and only the airfields themselves come
 * near white, and what is more than the knee of the heat is rolled off
 * before it is drawn (see heatTone), so the stops beyond it stand for ever
 * more flights.
 *
 * Most of the map is a route flown once to a few times, so the low end has
 * the most steps of lightness, with a stop of its own at two flights: over
 * the dark base map a quarter of a flight, one, two and four come out each
 * about half as light again as the one before, four flights' worth well
 * over twice as light as one where it was not quite twice, so a leg flown
 * five times stands out from one flown once. The two faintest stops are
 * the most transparent, so a route flown once is a soft line rather than a
 * band of even blue with crisp edges, and still off the base map; the heat
 * lines take the colours of the stops and not their opacity. The colours
 * in between are MapLibre's own blend of the stops either side.

 * around it in units of the few seconds a logger writes a fix in.
 *
 * But not every fix finds a cluster. The exporter keeps the vertices a KML
 * has, and those of a planned route or a slow logger are kilometres apart,
 * further than the cluster radius reaches. Such a fix stays a point of its
 * own at every zoom, of the capped heat of its segment (see heatWeight),
 * while the intensity keeps halving. MapLibre sizes the kernel of a point
 * from weight times intensity: under about 0.004 the
 * kernel shrinks, and under 0.0006 its size is not a number at all. So the
 * weight never lets a point contribute less than a fix does at the first
 * zoom without clusters, where it is a faint dot: at zoom z that takes a
 * weight of intensity(first) / intensity(z), one more power of two per
 * level out. Tried and dropped: a floor four times as high shows a sparse
 * track as a line at every zoom, but it also lifts the clusters of a lone
 * normal track, which then changes colour at the first zoom without them.
 *
 * A cluster of a normal track holds more heat than that at every zoom (see
 * HEATMAP_CLUSTER), so the floor leaves it alone. `zoom` may only be the
 * input of a top-level interpolation, hence a stop per half level with the
 * floor inside (HEATMAP_STOPS). Between two the floor falls as the
 * intensity grows, which the base 1/2 follows exactly where the reach
 * stays and to within a few per cent where it narrows; a heat above both
 * floors is the same at both stops and stays.
 *
 * Where the fixes are drawn as they are, a fix weighs its heat, which is
 * less than 1 for one a second or less on (a logger that writes every
 * second), and less again under an exposure below 1. Under the 0.0006 such
 * a point would drop out, and a track of them with it, so it keeps
 * HEATMAP_LEAST_POINT_CONTRIBUTION down to the zoom from which the
 * intensity stays.
 *
 * A point of the source may be several fixes of one pixel, `n` of them
 * (see mergedPoints in services/heatSource.ts), and is drawn as they were.
 * Each of them would have been lifted to the floor on its own, so the
 * floor of such a point is `n` times as high. And MapLibre cuts every
 * kernel off where it falls under 1 / 255 / 16, which takes about as much
 * out of a light point as out of a heavy one, HEATMAP_CUT_CONTRIBUTION:
 * one point where there were `n` loses that once instead of `n` times, so
 * it weighs as much less for every fix beyond the first. Without the two
 * the apron, hundreds of light fixes on top of one another, lost its white
 * or burned out into a blot.
