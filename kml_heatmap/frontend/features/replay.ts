 * along the curve the lines are drawn on (see calculations/curves.ts), and
 * when it is where.
 *
 * A segment's time is when it starts, so the one of the next segment is
 * when it ends. Moved evenly along each segment the airplane changed speed
 * at every fix, by as much as the logged speeds differ, which is a lot for
 * fixes of a few seconds. The distance flown is taken as a curve over time
 * instead, through the fixes at their times, with the speed at a fix the
 * harmonic mean of the segments on either side of it (Fritsch and
 * Butland): the speed changes smoothly, and the airplane never stops or
 * goes back on a segment where it did neither.
 *
 * The times themselves are smoothed first. A logger's times and positions
 * do not quite agree: in the sample data a fix 0.4 s after the one before
 * is 32 m on at 70 kt, as far as 0.9 s would take it, and the segments on
 * either side are slower by as much. The time of a fix is the one a
 * straight line of time over the distance flown gives it, fitted to
 * TIME_WINDOW fixes on either side, but never before the one of the fix
 * before, nor past the logged ones of its neighbours. The first and the
 * last fix keep theirs, and so does one where the flight stands.
