/**
 * Main Map Application
 * This is the main entry point that initializes all managers and handles the application lifecycle
 *
 * MapApp owns the map and its life: it creates the map and the handles of
 * its layers, starts the managers, runs the first load, dispatches clicks
 * on the map, fetches the lazy bundles as their controls are first used,
 * puts the view back on Reset view and takes everything down again in
 * `destroy()`. What it sets up once and then leaves to the store lives
 * next to it: the base style and its fallback (baseStyle.ts), the saved
 * state put back at start (ui/stateRestore.ts), the controls that follow
 * the store (ui/appChrome.ts) and what the app says when a lazy bundle
 * cannot be fetched (ui/lazyBundles.ts). The last three take the app as an
 * argument and use its public state only; what stays here is what needs
 * the app's private state.

   * has to keep its clicks to itself. For the same reason no popup of the
