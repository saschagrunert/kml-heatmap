/**
 * Flight time and distance of every flight of a dataset, which the flight
 * list of the statistics rail shows and sorts by (ui/flightList.ts).
 *
 * path_info carries neither, so both are worked out from the segments in
 * one pass over all of them, by the rules the statistics use: the time is
 * the span from the first to the last timed segment (perPathSeconds in
 * statistics.ts), the distance the sum of the segments' great-circle
 * lengths (segmentDistance, which the other statistics share). The result
 * is kept for as long as the dataset's index is (calculations/
 * datasetIndex.ts), so every filter, search and sort of the list reads it
 * again for free. Part of the lazily loaded Wrapped bundle.
