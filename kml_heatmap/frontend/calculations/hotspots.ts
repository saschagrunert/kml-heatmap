/**
 * The hotspots of the heat: the few places where the heat of a view is
 * strongest, which the hotspot tour flies to (ui/hotspotTour.ts).
 *
 * The heat is weighed as the heatmap, its lines and the heat cloud weigh
 * it (heatWeight, by the By distance switch): each segment's seconds, or
 * by distance the seconds of its length at ROUTE_SPEED_MS, half at either
 * end, added up in cells of a coarse grid about a kilometre wide. The cell
 * with the most heat around it seeds a hotspot, which takes in every cell
 * near it (HOTSPOT_RADIUS_M), so a field, its circuit and its holding
 * points are one place rather than three; the next seed is the next such
 * cell that is far enough from every hotspot kept (HOTSPOT_APART_M), and
 * so is the middle of its place. A place is
 * named after the nearest airport of the site, or by its distance and
 * direction from it.
 *
 * Only totals leave this module: the time spent at a place, or by distance
 * the distance flown there, and their share of the view's, never when.
