/**
 * Lookups derived from one dataset.
 *
 * Every value here is a pure function of the dataset and, for a filter view,
 * of the year/aircraft filter. The index is built on first use and kept in a
 * WeakMap beside the dataset: a new dataset starts from an empty index, and
 * no consumer has to compare arrays or lengths to notice that it changed.
 *
 * The per-path segment slices are one lookup kept elsewhere
 * (`segmentRangesFor` in statistics.ts): their callers hold a bare segment
 * array rather than a dataset, so that index hangs off the array instead.
 * The statistics of a view are another (`filterStatistics` in
 * panelStats.ts): only the lazily loaded panels show them.
