 *
 * The curves and their heights are the ribbons' (smoothing.ts, lift.ts):
 * each flight smoothed through its fixes, at its altitude above the ground
 * of its flight at the relief level the map is drawn for, never below it,
 * and on the relief the ground itself under that (see groundedFlights,
 * which both take them from). The ribbons stand on the relief MapLibre
 * draws, which that ground follows to within a pixel at every level (see
 * groundProfileFt); the cloud stands on the ground, since a custom layer
 * cannot ask the map for its relief.
 *
 * Each point also carries the time into its flight it was flown at, which
 * the pulses of the layer run along, and the heat is added up in coarse
 * cells on the way, for the exposure the layer draws the cloud with.
