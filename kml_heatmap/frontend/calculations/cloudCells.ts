 * CLOUD_MARK_SPACING_PX in ui/heatCloudShaders.ts).
 *
 * A mark points the way its own flight was flown. Where flights overlap
 * in both directions, a runway used both ways, a circuit flown left for
 * one runway and right for the other, or a route flown out and back,
 * marks of both would point either way at the same places and say
 * nothing: a stretch draws them only where the flights around it go its
 * way. The directions of the stretches in a cell are added up weighed by
 * their heat, the seconds spent there as the heatmap weighs them, and a
 * stretch takes of the cells it passes how far the flights along its own
 * axis go its way rather than the other (agreement). Flights across it
 * count for neither, so a crossing of two routes keeps the marks of both.
 * The heat alone takes nothing away: the flights along a track draw their
 * marks at the same places, so a busy one draws one row of them, not a
 * haze.
 *
 * The same cells roll the heat of the stretches off (see heatTone), as
 * the flat heatmap rolls off its points by the heat of theirs: a stretch
 * over the busiest cells of a home field is drawn with the few flights'
 * worth their heat rolls off to, so its circuits keep their steps of
 * colour rather than glowing as one white blob.
