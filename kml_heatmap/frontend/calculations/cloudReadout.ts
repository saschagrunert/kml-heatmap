/**
 * The readout of the heat cloud: what the cloud under the pointer is made
 * of, as time spent (or distance flown, by distance), flights and heights
 * (see ui/cloudReadout.ts). A custom layer has no features the map could
 * look under the pointer for, so the readout is worked out from the
 * segments themselves.
 *
 * "Under the pointer" is the line of sight through it. The cloud is drawn
 * at the heights of the flights and adds up every glow on a pixel (see
 * CLOUD_COLOUR in ui/heatCloudLayer.ts), so a pixel shows every flight the
 * line of sight passes near, at any height: a circuit at 1,000 ft in front
 * of the ground under the pointer and a route at 5,000 ft beyond it alike.
 * Taking the ground under the pointer instead would miss the glow pointed
 * at in a tilted view, where the flights stand up the screen from their
 * ground. The line is sampled at heights above the ground (SightLine), each
 * with the place on the ground below the point of the line at that height,
 * and a segment counts where it comes within the radius of the place of
 * its own height. Looking straight down, every height has the same place.
 *
 * The time is the cloud's: the heat of each segment in seconds, weighed as
 * the heatmap, its lines and the cloud weigh it (heatWeight: by time or by
 * distance), of the part of the segment within the radius. The segments
 * near a place are found in a grid of cells twice the radius
 * (segmentGrid), made the first time a radius is asked for and kept with
 * the dataset, those of the last few radii. The readout makes it ahead of
 * the pointer, where the map comes to rest (see readoutKept).
