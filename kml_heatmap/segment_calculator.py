"""Segment calculation for path data with groundspeed and altitude analysis.

Groundspeed uses a two-pass approach: instantaneous speeds for all segments,
then rolling window averages for smoothing. The window keeps running totals
of distance and time over the segments sorted by time, so each lookup is a
binary search and two subtractions, whatever the width of the window.
Timestamps are Unix epoch seconds that were parsed once by the KML parser.

A groundspeed that cannot be measured, or that is implausible, is None
(unknown), never 0: a 0 would read as standing still.
