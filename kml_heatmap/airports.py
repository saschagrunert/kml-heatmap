"""Airport deduplication, name extraction and the altitude heuristics behind it.

Uses a spatial grid approach for O(1) proximity lookups: divides the map into
~2km grid cells and checks the cells within the merge distance for nearby
airports, avoiding O(n^2) pairwise distance checks. The grid wraps around the
antimeridian, so fields on either side of it are neighbors too.

An entry whose name holds an ICAO code only ever merges with entries of the
same code: EDTX and EDTY are 0.7 km apart and two airports all the same. Only
entries without a code merge by proximity (see ``AirportDeduplicator``).
