"""Check that a generated site, or the installed package, has every file the page loads.

The packaging job of .github/workflows/test.yml installs the wheel and runs
this twice: with --package against the package it installed, and against the
site that package generates, and then against the sites the image generates.
A file the wheel or the image leaves out fails all of them at once, from the
one list below, rather than from one copy of it per build.

--package has to run with the Python of the environment the wheel went into,
outside the checkout: run as a script, only scripts/ is put in front of the
import path, so `kml_heatmap` is the installed package and not the sources.
