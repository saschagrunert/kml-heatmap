"""Git pre-push hook: refuse to push KML files that carry real dates.

The repository is public, so the obfuscation check of CI only notices a real
date once it has been published. This hook runs the same check before the
push, on every KML file that the commits about to be pushed add or change,
including commits whose files a later commit fixes again: the history is
published, not just its tip. Commits the remote already has are skipped:
those of its remote-tracking branches, and those of the refs being pushed to
where they are in the clone. Not those of another remote, a fork or a mirror
whose commits the public remote may never have had: a private remote may hold
the raw flights. A push to a URL or to a remote never fetched from has no
remote-tracking branches of its own, so only the refs being pushed to count,
and a first push to a new remote checks the whole history. When that history
is already public elsewhere and clean, `git push --no-verify` skips it.

Install it once per clone with `make hooks`. It needs nothing but the
Python the project requires, and it fails closed: when it cannot run the
check, the push is refused. `git push --no-verify` skips it.

The messages of the commits that add or change a flight in data/ are
published with it: one that names a date or a weekday ("Add flight 16 Aug
2026") is refused as well.

So are the names of the refs pushed to: a branch named after the day of
its flights ("flights-2026-08-16") is refused when its commits add or
change one.

A push that adds the flights of one trip to data/ gets a warning, not a
refusal: the files carry no date, but the push does, and dates the trip to
about the day it was pushed. One trip is up to three flights (a day's
flying), or legs that each start where the one before ended and come back
to the field of the first only at the end (see ``one_trip``).
