"""Build the site the visual snapshots are compared against.

The snapshots of tests/e2e/visual.spec.ts are compared pixel for pixel, so
nothing they show may depend on when or where the site was built. data/
grows with every flight, which used to move the figures of the statistics
rail and of Wrapped; this builds tests/fixtures/visual/ instead, a handful of
flights that only change on purpose, into visual-site/.

Everything else that varies between builds is pinned here as well: the build
stamp of the statistics panel, the airport and runway databases and the tile
API key. The ground under the flights is left out (--no-terrain): sampling it
would fetch elevation tiles, and the one snapshot of the 3D view it is for,
the heat cloud's, is as fixed without it, with each flight on a line between
its airfields over the flat elevation tiles of the e2e fixture. Run
`npm run build` first; the generator needs the bundles.
