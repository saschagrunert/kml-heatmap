# Scripts

The build helpers `build.js` imports, the repository consistency check, the
pre-push hook, the test data generator, the builder of the site the visual
snapshots use, the check of the files a generated site needs and the list of the
slowest e2e tests of a CI run. The JavaScript files are type-checked with
`tsconfig.node.json` (`npm run typecheck`).

## generate_test_data.py

Generates realistic test KML files with curved flight paths between major
European airports.

### Features

- Curved flight paths using quadratic Bezier curves (not straight lines)
- Random deviations to spread data across Germany for better heatmap
  visualization
- Realistic altitude profiles (climb, cruise, descend)
- SkyDemon-style filenames (`N_REGISTRATION_TYPE.kml`)
- The same files for the same `--seed` (42 unless given)
- Two formats (`--format`), both at a groundspeed of 90 to 150 kt:
  - `gx-track` (the default): a `gx:Track` with a `<when>` for every point, as
    SkyDemon writes it, at the pace of the flight (its 50 points are one to
    three minutes apart)
  - `linestring`: a `LineString` with the start and end of the flight in a
    `<TimeSpan>` and no per-point times, so the speed layer falls back to path
    averages: the length of the path over its duration

### Usage

```bash
# Generate 1000 files (default)
python3 scripts/generate_test_data.py

# Generate 10000 files
python3 scripts/generate_test_data.py 10000

# Generate 5000 files to custom directory
python3 scripts/generate_test_data.py 5000 --output custom_test_data

# Other flights, as lines without per-point times
python3 scripts/generate_test_data.py 100 --seed 7 --format linestring

# See all options
python3 scripts/generate_test_data.py --help
```

### Testing generated data

Generating a site reads the KML files and leaves them alone; only
`--obfuscate-inputs` or `make obfuscate` rewrites them. The generated files
carry no real dates anyway.

```bash
# Build with test data
make build INPUT_DIR=kml_test_10000

# Or with Docker
mkdir -p out ~/.cache/kml-heatmap
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  -v "$PWD/kml_test_10000:/data/kml_test_10000" -v "$PWD/out:/data/out" \
  -v ~/.cache/kml-heatmap:/cache \
  kml-heatmap kml_test_10000 --output-dir out
```

### Performance testing

Recommended test sizes:

Every file holds 50 points and takes about 6.4 KB as a `gx:Track` (3.4 KB with
`--format linestring`).

- **1k flights**: Quick test, ~6.4 MB source data
- **10k flights**: Standard test, ~64 MB source data
- **100k flights**: Stress test, ~640 MB source data (about 5M points); the 10
  minutes of parallel parsing and export were measured on the `linestring` files
  (~340 MB)

These numbers are the reference for the processing time mentioned in
[Data export](../doc/output.md#data-export). The system has been tested and
optimized to handle 100k+ flights.

## check_locks.py

Checks the versions that are written down in more than one place, which nothing
else reads together:

- `requirements.lock` and `requirements-test.lock` still satisfy the ranges in
  `pyproject.toml`, and the two agree on every package both pin (CI installs
  `requirements-test.lock` alone where it needs both). `requirements-build.lock`
  satisfies `build-system.requires` (the setuptools CI builds the wheel with),
  and `requirements-tools.lock` the pip-tools pin in `requirements-tools.in`
  (what `make lock` runs). Dependabot bumps `pyproject.toml` and
  `requirements-tools.in` without recompiling the locks, so this fails such a
  pull request with a hint to run `make lock`.
- The Playwright image of the `e2e` and `visual` jobs in
  `.github/workflows/test.yml` is the same in both, pinned by its `@sha256`
  digest, its tag matches the `@playwright/test` version in `package-lock.json`,
  and `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `doc/development/testing.md` quote exactly the same
  image reference. A document that is missing, or quotes no image, fails the
  check too, rather than leaving the command it moved to unchecked.
- `__version__` in `kml_heatmap/__init__.py` matches `version` in `package.json`
  and both version fields of `package-lock.json`.
- The Python version of `.python-version` is the one of the `python` base images
  in the `Dockerfile`, `requires-python`, mypy's `python_version` and ruff's
  `target-version`, and the Node.js major version of `.nvmrc` is the one of the
  `node` base image and `engines` in `package.json`. Dependabot bumps none of
  them, so they move together by hand.

The pre-commit hook revisions are not checked: the linters and formatters run
from the project environment, so they have no revision of their own to drift.
`make lint` and the CI lint job run it.

## pre_push.py

The pre-push hook, installed once per clone with `make hooks`. It runs the
obfuscation check on every KML file that the commits about to be pushed add or
change, and refuses the push when one carries a real date or when it cannot run
the check. It also refuses a commit message that dates a flight the commit adds
or changes (`Add flight 16 Aug 2026`), and warns when the push adds a single
flight, which the commit then dates to about the day it was pushed. It needs
nothing beyond Python; `--no-verify` skips it.

`make hooks` installs a copy of `pre-push-hook`, which runs `pre_push.py` of the
worktree the push comes from: the worktrees of a clone share one hooks
directory, and a link into the worktree that installed it would dangle once that
worktree is removed, which git skips without a word. Without a `pre_push.py` to
run, the wrapper refuses the push.

## build_visual_site.py

Builds `visual-site/`, the site the visual snapshots are compared against (see
[Visual snapshots](../CONTRIBUTING.md#visual-snapshots)), from the fixture
flights in `tests/fixtures/visual/`. The snapshots allow no differing pixel, so
the script pins what would otherwise vary from build to build: the build time
and commit the statistics panel prints, the airport and runway databases
(`tests/fixtures/airports.csv` and `runways.csv` in a throwaway cache directory,
so nothing is downloaded) and the tile API key. Run `npm run build` first.

```bash
python scripts/build_visual_site.py
```

## check_site_files.py

Checks that a generated site has every file the page loads (the page, its
configuration, the six bundles, the four stylesheets, the vendored MapLibre and
html-to-image files and `data/metadata.json`), each of them not empty, or with
`--package`, that the installed `kml_heatmap` package ships the template and the
same assets and none of their source maps. CI runs it on the wheel it installed,
on the site that wheel generates and on the sites the container image generates
(all in the `packaging` job), from the one list in the script. Run `--package`
with the Python of the environment the package is installed in, outside the
checkout, so the installed package is imported and not the sources.

```bash
python scripts/check_site_files.py docs
python scripts/check_site_files.py --package
```

## smoke_site.py

Sets up and checks the small sites the `packaging` job generates the way a user
would, from the wheel and from the image. `prepare <dir>` makes `<dir>/input`
with the first three flights of `data/`, `<dir>/cache` with the airport and
runway fixtures in place of the OurAirports downloads and an empty `<dir>/site`
(`--world-writable` for a run as the image's own user); `check <dir>` runs the
site check above and fails when the fixtures in the cache were replaced, that is
when the build downloaded something. Standard library only, since the image's
builds run it with the runner's Python.

```bash
python scripts/smoke_site.py prepare /tmp/smoke
KML_HEATMAP_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/smoke/cache \
  kml-heatmap --no-terrain /tmp/smoke/input --output-dir /tmp/smoke/site
python scripts/smoke_site.py check /tmp/smoke
```

The cache directory is the one the build reads: `KML_HEATMAP_CACHE_DIR` for the
installed package, the `/cache` mount for the image.

## e2e_durations.js

Lists the slowest attempts of the e2e tests from the report of Playwright's JSON
reporter, which CI writes to `test-results/e2e-timings.json` and uploads from
every e2e job as the `e2e-timings-<job>` artifact, whether the run passed or
not. Each line gives the duration, the share of the test's timeout it took, the
result, the project, the spec and the title; a retry is listed as an attempt of
its own. It needs nothing but Node.js, so it runs on a downloaded artifact:

```bash
node scripts/e2e_durations.js e2e-timings.json          # the 20 slowest
node scripts/e2e_durations.js --limit 50 */e2e-timings.json
```

## build-helpers.js

What `build.js` does without building, kept apart because `build.js` runs a
build as it is imported: the GLSL of the custom layers written as a minified
build ships it (`tightenGlsl`, `tightenShaders`), the sizes of the files, the
check that the build wrote only the six bundles the site publishes
(`assertExpectedOutputs`), the composition of a bundle and the flags of the
command. `tests/frontend/unit/glsl.test.ts` holds the tightened shaders of every
`ui/*Layer.ts` and `ui/*Shaders.ts` to the same tokens as written, and
`tests/frontend/unit/buildHelpers.test.ts` the rest.

After the sizes, a production build prints what each bundle is made of, by kind
of module and its ten largest modules. `npm run build -- --metafile [path]`
keeps esbuild's metafile, the account of every module in every bundle
(`bundle-meta.json` in the checkout without a path, gitignored), and
`npm run build -- --compare <path>` prints what changed in each bundle since the
build that wrote that file, the largest change first: build `main` with
`--metafile`, then a branch with `--compare`, to see where its bytes went.

## source-hash.js

The content hash of everything that shapes a built site: the TypeScript sources
in `kml_heatmap/frontend/`, the files in `BUILD_FILES` (`build.js`,
`scripts/build-helpers.js`, `scripts/vendor.js`, `tsconfig.json` and the three
stylesheets) and the versions `package-lock.json` pins for `BUILD_PACKAGES`
(esbuild, Lucide as the one package bundled into the page, and MapLibre,
html-to-image and flag-icons, which are vendored next to the bundles).
`build.js` writes it into the first line of every bundle. A Playwright fixture
(`tests/e2e/site-check.ts`) compares that line in the `mapApp.bundle.js` of the
site under test (`docs/`, or `visual-site/` for the snapshots) with the
checkout, so the e2e tests refuse to run against a stale site, and the generator
warns when the bundle it is about to publish is stale.
`kml_heatmap/site_assets.py` mirrors the hash in Python; `TestSourceHashParity`
in `tests/test_site_assets.py` checks that both implementations agree.

## vendor.js

Copies the third-party files the published page loads (the three modules of
MapLibre GL JS with its stylesheet) out of `node_modules` into
`kml_heatmap/static/vendor/`, bundles the module of html-to-image into one file
next to them (the package ships it as a dozen, and the page imports it with
`import()` on the first export), and copies every country flag of `flag-icons`
into `kml_heatmap/static/flags/`. Both directories are generated and gitignored,
and each build replaces them, so a file dropped from the list does not linger. A
copy differs from its original in the closing `sourceMappingURL` comment, left
off because the maps (five megabytes for MapLibre) are not shipped and every
DevTools session would ask for them and get a 404, and the MapLibre modules in
five fixes of a few characters each for what the app cannot do from the outside
(`VENDOR_PATCHES` in `vendor.js`). Three are in `maplibre-gl.mjs`, for bugs:
tiles of the chase view's trail culled below the camera on the relief, the raw
data of before kept by a GeoJSON tile that loads empty, and, in WebKit on Linux
alone (WebKitGTK as in Epiphany, and WPE, Playwright's WebKit), elevation tiles
read into pixels on the main thread rather than sent to MapLibre's worker as
bitmaps, which crashed or hung the page's process there (`LINUX_WEBKIT` in
`vendor.js` tells that browser by `navigator.platform` and the user agent). The
texts of their upstream issues are with the owner and not filed yet. The other
two, one in `maplibre-gl-shared.mjs` and one in `maplibre-gl-worker.mjs`, let
MapLibre's worker read a GeoJSON source from a `blob:` URL without the main
thread, as the heat sources are given (see
[The heat sources and the year worker](../doc/development/heat.md#the-heat-sources-and-the-year-worker)).
A fix that no longer matches exactly once fails the build, so a MapLibre bump
shows whether it is still needed. The stylesheet is copied without the styles of
the controls the app never adds (`VENDOR_CSS_STRIPS`): the navigation,
fullscreen, globe, terrain, geolocate, logo and scale controls, whose icons as
`data:` URIs were three quarters of its 83 KB. Every rule whose selectors all
name one of them is left out, and the build fails when the number of such rules
is not the one recorded, so a bump that adds or renames a control gets looked
at. Serving the files from the site keeps the page working during a CDN outage,
keeps visitors' addresses away from CDNs and leaves `package-lock.json` as the
one place their versions are pinned. `kml_heatmap/site_assets.py` keeps its own
list of the files it publishes, in step with `VENDOR_FILES` and
`VENDOR_MODULES`, which `tests/test_site_assets.py` checks;
`tests/frontend/unit/vendor.test.ts` checks both against `node_modules`. The
wheel ships `vendor/` but not `flags/`, and the Python side publishes only the
flags of the countries an export visited.
