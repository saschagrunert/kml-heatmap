# Map features

What the page shows and how it is used: the heat and the other layers, the
controls, the filters, the links that share a view, and what the generator works
out on its own.

## Heat and layers

The Layers group holds the heatmap first, then what is drawn over or instead of
it.

### Heatmap

The Heatmap switch shows where the time was spent: every logged position counts
for the seconds until the next one, so a flight logged every 2 seconds weighs as
much as one logged every 5. Its brightness follows what it draws: the busiest
routes and circuits of a year, of one aircraft or of a shared flight come out
alike, and a logbook of many years does not wash out to white. The busiest
places are rolled off before they are coloured, so a home field flown hundreds
of times keeps its circuit, final and runway apart in the lightest colours
rather than burning out into one white shape, while a route flown once to a few
times gets the most steps of blue. Over a region the heat narrows to the tracks
rather than a haze, and while it is drawn the base map's place and region names
step back a little on a dark outline, so they stay legible without breaking it
up. The wide grey band along country borders is drawn faintly, so it does not
read as a flight. It stays on over a few towns around a field, its tracks a
little wider there so they stay lines, and zoomed in from `z` 12 to 13.75 (the
`z` of a [shared link](#shareable-urls)) it hands over to heat lines: the tracks
themselves, coloured and widened by the time spent on each 40 m of them, so the
taxiways and circuits of a busy airport stay apart.

Its legend is one short row, "Time spent", less on the left and more on the
right; pointing at it says how many passes of a flight the two ends stand for
(about 1 and 64, as the brightness follows the flights drawn), and so does a
screen reader.

In the 3D view the heat is a cloud in the air instead: every flight glows where
it flew, at its height as the 3D view draws it, along the same curve as its
ribbon, and brighter the more time was spent there; from `z` 10.5 in the glow
narrows to a crisp line along each track, so the roads and place names stay
readable, and close in it follows the taxiways and the corners of a circuit as
the heat lines do. A route flown once is a faint blue, the circuits and the
climbs out of a busy field glow white, and a ridge in front of a flight hides
its glow. Where so many flights overlap that more than a hundredth of the cloud
would glow past white, the whole cloud is drawn darker; it is never drawn
brighter, and its busiest places are rolled off as the heatmap's are. It fades
with the distance from the camera, into a haze towards the horizon of a tilted
map, and the tracks nearest the camera stay narrow.

A faint copy of the glow on the ground under the flights shows how high they
were, and pulses run along every track the way it was flown, for 8 seconds after
the map was last used and not at all with reduced motion. Whenever they do not
run (with reduced motion, on a map at rest, in an exported image and during a
replay), faint chevrons along the tracks point the way they were flown instead,
at the same places for every flight along a track, and only where most of the
time there was flown one way: a runway or a circuit flown both ways, or a route
flown out and back, shows none. They fade out from `z` 10 to `z` 8.5, where the
routes of a region run together.

The cloud follows the same switch, filters and share mode as the heatmap, and
steps back under the Aviation layer and the lines of a selection as it does, but
not under the ribbons of a colour layer, which are drawn in front of it; during
a replay it stays at a quarter of its strength and without its pulses, so the
chase view flies through the flights of before, and the Heatmap switch shows as
on. Hovering and clicking still go to the flights, and resting the pointer on
the cloud tells what it is made of as well (see
[Heat cloud readout](#heat-cloud-readout) below). Should the browser not run its
shaders, the flat heatmap stays until the browser gives the map a new WebGL
context.

### Altitude and Groundspeed

The Altitude switch colours the paths by elevation, on a scale that runs purple
through magenta to orange, and the Groundspeed switch colours them by
groundspeed, on a scale that runs blue through green to yellow. The two scales
share no hue, so a map or an exported image says which of them is drawn without
its legend; both brighten from end to end, so they survive being printed in
grey. Both colour layers draw 32 steps of their scale, one line per run of a
path in the same step, and draw every recorded point, joined by a smooth curve
through the fixes. The colours are spread by rank rather than evenly over the
values: every stretch of a scale colours as much of the flying as any other, so
the climb-out, the cruise and the taxiing each get colours of their own, and the
middle of the legend names the median. The altitude scale runs from the lowest
to the highest altitude drawn; the speed scale spans the middle nine tenths of
the speeds drawn (from the 5th to the 95th percentile), and the slower and
faster ones take the colours of its ends, which the legend marks with ≤ and ≥.
Each label of the legend gives the value in both units, feet or knots over
metres or km/h, and the two legends are as wide, so the box keeps its width as
one takes the other's place. A selection and a replay are coloured on their own
flights. Hovering a path shows the exact value.

### Airports

The Airports switch shows the airport markers with their ICAO codes above them.
The codes are placed together with the place names of the base map, so they
never cover one another, nor the dot of another airport; where a code above its
dot has no room, the home base and then the busier airport keep theirs, and the
others come back as you zoom in. They are left out below `z` 5, and on a map
tilted past about 55 degrees the airports more than twice as far from the camera
as the middle of the map are hidden, markers and codes, where they would crowd
into a strip along the horizon. Below `z` 3 the markers are hidden too, a clump
of dots on the heat.

### Aviation

The Aviation switch overlays airspaces, airports, navaids, and reporting points
from open flightmaps, where it has coverage. It is drawn from `z` 7 to 14; its
charts end at `z` 12, and further in than two levels of upscaling they would
only blur the base map. The start view is further out than `z` 7, so its label
says the charts show once zoomed in.

## Controls

### Search

Find an airport or a place and take the map there: **Search** at the top of the
View group, `/` anywhere but in a text field (a checkbox is none) or an open
sheet or dialog, or the Search row of the More sheet on a phone. The field lists
the airports of this map first, found as you type by their ICAO code, name or
country (without regard to case or accents), and then the places Photon finds in
OpenStreetMap, each with a short line under it (the country, or the kind of
place and its region). Places are searched from three characters on, once you
pause typing or press Enter with nothing listed, and the answers to the last 50
texts are kept for the visit, so none of them is asked again; the line under the
list says while it searches, when nothing was found, and when Photon cannot be
reached, takes longer than 10 seconds or the browser is offline, where the
airports are still found. Photon is asked for what you type and nothing else
(see [Privacy](privacy.md#requests-to-other-servers)); the panel credits it and
OpenStreetMap.

The arrow keys move through the list, Enter takes the option they are on, or the
first one, and Escape, a press beside the panel or Tab out of it closes it. An
airport is flown to and its popup opens, as a click on its marker opens it but
without selecting its flights, with the keyboard's focus on its marker; where
the marker is not shown (the Airports switch is off, or the filter leaves it
out) a pulse marks it instead. A place is fitted to its extent where Photon
gives one, at a zoom for its kind otherwise, and marked with a pulse until the
next pick or Escape. The map keeps its bearing and tilt, frames the place clear
of the panels over it, and jumps rather than flies under reduced motion. Replay,
Replay all, the hotspot tour and Wrapped hold the search while they run, and
close it as they start.

### Statistics

View statistics (distance, altitude, landings, airports, flight time). Flight
time runs from the first to the last recorded point that moved at the exported
precision (about 1 m), so standing perfectly still before and after is not
counted, while GPS noise on the ground still is.

The panel's Flights tab lists every flight of the year and aircraft filter with
its route, aircraft, year, flight time, distance, highest altitude and full-stop
landings (a year, never a date); the landings cell names the touch-and-goes as
well when the pointer rests on it, and flights without timestamps have no
landings. The rows start in the order of the flight files; a column header sorts
by it, up, down and back. The search keeps the flights whose airports (code or
name), registration or type match every word typed. A click on a row selects
that flight alone; its checkbox, or a click with Ctrl or Cmd held, adds it to
the selection or takes it out, which is also how a phone puts several flights
together. Shift sets every flight from the row clicked last in that list to this
one, in the order the list shows, to what this row's checkbox goes to: in, or
out where it was ticked. A sort, a search or a closed list starts the range
afresh. In share mode only the checkbox adds or removes a flight (with Shift for
a range): a click on the rest of a row brings a shared flight into view, and
says how to add one that is not shared. During a replay or the hotspot tour the
selection stays as it is. A flight picked alone, here or from an airport's
popup, is brought into view clear of the panels and of its altitude profile,
unless all of it is in view already, the map was moved meanwhile, or the hotspot
tour or Wrapped has it; a flight in view that spans less than a quarter of the
map between the panels either way, such as a circuit round the home field, is
framed as well, no closer than a replay follows a flight. A click on a flight on
the map leaves the map where it is. The arrow keys move between the two tabs. On
a phone the same tabs are inside the statistics sheet, which Escape closes as
well as its tab (not an Escape for a popup, a marker, the readout of the heat
cloud or the search of the flights); a flight picked alone there, or from an
airport's popup, closes the sheet and the popup, which stood over the map it is
shown on.

### Export image

Save the current map view as a JPG image. To print the map, export it as an
image first: the browser's print dialog cannot capture the WebGL map.

### Copy link

Copy the current URL to the clipboard. On a phone, where there is a native share
dialog, the More sheet's row says **Share link** and opens that instead.

### Wrapped

View the year-in-review summary; Escape closes it. Opened from its button, it
starts with the map filling the dialog and the title of the year over the globe,
and, in an intro of about ten seconds, a flight down towards your home base, two
zoom levels closer than the overview, so the routes of the year show around it,
over the heat cloud of the year (every flight the year and aircraft filters
keep, at full strength, whatever the Heatmap switch, share mode or a colour
layer say), while the flights of the summary play underneath at 300x, as in
Replay all (at their height in the heat) but drawn larger; then the cloud fades
into the heatmap, back on the map's own projection, and it settles on the
overview as the cards come in one after another and the map draws back into its
panel beside them (below 1024 px wide, where the cards are stacked, it fades
from over them instead); Skip intro, or a press, wheel or key on the map, goes
straight to the summary, and the flight does not play while the system asks for
reduced motion.

Beside the map the cards scroll in a column of their own, each as tall as its
content, and **More below** at the foot of the first takes the column to the
next card while there is more below. Resting the pointer on a destination flies
the map there, and leaving the list flies it back. For a year it names the new
airspace, the square kilometres its flights passed over and no flight of an
earlier year did, once the page holds the earlier years (after the view of all
years or each earlier year was shown); it does not load them itself.

### Replay

Animate one flight with adjustable speed (1x to 500x, default 50x) and an
auto-zoom button that follows the airplane; Escape closes it. The whole track is
drawn dimmed and the flown part paints over it in the colours of the active
scale. Replay needs a selected flight with timing data; a toast explains why it
is unavailable otherwise, and with nothing selected the Flights tab of the
statistics opens to pick one from; in share mode, where the filter hides every
shared flight, it says they are hidden by the filter. A replay, Replay all and
the flights one after another put away a flight's or an airport's popup left
open as they start. With two to eight selected, Replay plays them one after
another (see [Replay all](#replay-all)); with more, such as all of an airport's,
it is unavailable and says that Replay all plays more. A flight is picked on the
map only where it is drawn, with Altitude or Groundspeed on.

The chase button (the target next to auto-zoom) watches the flight from a chase
plane: the camera sits behind and above the airplane, tilted to 70 degrees at
about `z` 15.5, and turns with it, lagging a little into each turn. The airplane
stands upright, a little below the middle of the map above the replay panel. In
the 3D view the camera looks at the airplane at its height and tilts down
steeper rather than fly into a ridge behind it. Switching it on slows a replay
faster than 10x down to 10x, and switching it off brings back the speed from
before, unless another one was chosen while it chased. Dragging, zooming or
turning the map holds the chase until you let go, and the chase keeps the zoom
(`z` 12 to 17) and tilt (45 to 75 degrees) you left it at. On the globe it zooms
out no further than `z` 13, where the globe is still drawn flat. Switching it
off gives back your zoom, turn and tilt over the airplane, and closing the
replay gives back the whole view from before; the link and the saved session
keep that view, not the chase camera. It stays off while the system asks for
reduced motion, and a toast says why.

### Replay all

Play every flight the filters and share mode keep at once, each from its own
first fix, at 100x to 1000x (default 200x): each flight is a bright head with a
trail that fades behind it (over at most 25 minutes of flight), at its height as
in the 3D view, on the flat map as well. Behind the heads the heat builds up as
far as they have flown, in the heatmap's colours, and ends as the whole heat of
the flights; it is the heat cloud's glow at the height of the flights, with its
shadow on the ground, and none is drawn while the Heatmap switch is off.

The clock reads the time into every flight ("0:42 into every flight"), never a
date or an hour, and the slider beside it moves along the same clock: drag it
(the replay holds while you drag and plays on as you let go), click it to jump,
backwards as well, or use the arrow keys for a minute at a time and Home and End
for either end. A flight without times takes its length at its groundspeed, and
one with neither sits out.

The map fits the flights north up, as large as the map allows clear of the
controls and the panel, and a flat map is tilted as the 3D view tilts it, so the
heights show, and laid flat again as it ends unless you tilted it yourself or
turned the 3D view on meanwhile (the link and the saved session keep the tilt
from before); the orbit button turns it slowly round them until you move the
map, and stays off while the system asks for reduced motion, and a toast says
why. The filters, the selection, the layers and Wrapped are held while it plays,
as during a replay, and come back as they were; their titles say to end the
replay to change them. Escape or the close button ends it. On a phone it is in
the More sheet, and its panel is laid out like the replay's: the clock on a line
of its own, the close button in the corner and the controls in one row, the
slider between play and the speed.

With two to eight flights selected, Replay plays them in the same panel one
after another instead, for a quick look at a day of several: in the order of
their files (by year, then as the files were read), each starting once the one
before has landed and a pause of 5 minutes of flight has passed (1.5 seconds at
200x), at the same speeds and with the same slider, tilt, fit and orbit. Never
the time on the ground between them, nor a date or an hour. The clock names the
flight in the air and the time into it ("2 of 3, EDDS → EDTF: 0:42 in"). The
trails stay until the last flight has landed, fading over the whole run so the
first flight ends a quarter as bright as the last, and no heat builds up behind
them. Selected flights without timing data to play by are left out, and a toast
says how many. A drag or a click to the end of the slider stays at the end,
paused, rather than start again from the first flight. Replay is the control
that ends it, with Escape and the close button; Replay all is held meanwhile.

### Hotspot tour

Fly over the busiest places of what the heatmap shows, in the 3D view with the
heat cloud: up to five places, where the heat of the flights the filters and
share mode keep is strongest (weighed as the heatmap is, and the neighbouring
cells of a place taken together, at least 8 km apart). Each is named after its
airport ("Home field EDAQ Halle-Oppin" for the home base), or by its distance
and direction from the nearest one ("18 km south-east of EDAQ Halle-Oppin"), and
captioned with the time spent there ("4 h 58 min") and its share of the view's
time; never a date or an hour. The camera flies to each place, tilted, and turns
slowly over it for a few seconds before it moves on.

Pause, the previous and the next place and Stop are in its panel, and the
caption is read out as it changes. Played to the end, stopped or ended with
Escape, it flies back to the view it started from and turns the 3D view and the
heatmap back to what they were; a press, a wheel or a key on the map ends it
where it is instead, in the 3D view, for you to look round from there. While the
system asks for reduced motion it cuts to each place and waits for the next or
previous button. The filters, the selection, Replay, Replay all, Wrapped and the
Cross-section are held while it runs (an open cross-section closes as it
starts), and it does not start during a replay. On a phone it is in the More
sheet, and its panel takes the bottom edge while the bar of tabs steps aside, as
for a replay. Next and the previous place while it is paused fly there and wait,
and the relief and the cloud follow the view they arrive at.

### Altitude profile

With a flight selected, a strip at the bottom of the map draws its altitude over
time (over the distance flown for a flight without times), with the ground
filled in underneath, and the highest altitude, the lowest height above the
ground en route and the time spent below 1,000 ft above it en route ("5 min", "1
h 12 min", never a clock that reads as hours); en route leaves out 2 km around
each airfield. Pointing at the chart reads out the values there and marks the
place on the map, and pointing at the flight on the map moves the chart's
cursor. A click or a drag on it (a tap on a phone) opens the replay paused at
that moment; during a replay the chart is its timeline, and during the replay of
all flights it is put away. The button with the mountain on the selection chip
puts it away and brings it back, and the browser remembers which.

With two to eight flights selected, it draws them one after another in the order
of their files, each named by its route over its part of the chart ("EDDS →
EDTF") and parted from the next by a dashed line and a narrow gap of the same
width each time, never the time on the ground; it runs over the distance flown
unless every one of them has times, and ends with how many flights it shows. The
figures are those of all of them, the readout gives the time into the flight
pointed at (a point in a gap reads the nearer end of a flight), and a click on
one with times opens the replay of them one after another, paused at that
moment, also where the chart runs over the distance; the pointer turns into a
hand over those, and a click on one without times says it has no timing data.
Where only one of them has a profile, it is drawn as a single flight. More than
eight have no profile.

### Cross-section

Draw a line on the map and see, side on, where the time was spent within a
corridor either side of it: the distance along the line across, the height up,
as a density image in the heatmap's colours and weighed like it (the seconds
each stretch of a flight took, at most two minutes). Click or tap its two ends,
or drag it; from the keyboard, "Set A at the map centre" and then B place them
where the middle of the map is, so move the map between the two. Escape takes
back a point being placed, or the line being redrawn, and otherwise closes it.
The ends (A and B) can be dragged afterwards, or moved with the arrow keys once
focused (Shift for bigger steps), and the ruler button draws a new line.

The corridor is drawn on the map while it is open. It is 250 m, 500 m, 1, 2 or 5
km either side, picked for the zoom as the line is drawn (about 40 px on the
screen, 500 m over a traffic circuit) and then from its list. Heights are above
the ground under each fix (AGL; above the field for a flight without terrain) or
above sea level (MSL), which draws the ground under the flights beneath them;
the chart reaches up to where all but half a per cent of the time was spent, and
says how much was higher up. It counts the flights of the year and aircraft
filters, and while flights are selected only those, so a click on a flight shows
it alone. The line is in the link and the saved session (see
[Shareable URLs](#shareable-urls)), and a page opened with it opens the tool on
that line; the width of the corridor and the choice of AGL or MSL are in
neither, so the tool picks the width for the zoom again and starts with heights
above the ground.

The figures give the time, the number of flights and the band of height the most
time in the air was spent in; pointing at the chart (or a finger on it) reads
out the distance, the band of height and the time of the cells there, and marks
the place on the line on the map. The chart's summary is its accessible name and
is announced as the line comes to rest; no date or time of day is shown. It
takes the place of the altitude profile at the bottom of the map while it is
open, and replay, Replay all, Wrapped and the hotspot tour close it. On a phone
it is in the More sheet.

### North up

The map turns and tilts (up to 85 degrees, with a sky above the horizon) by
gesture: drag with the right mouse button or with Ctrl held, twist or drag with
two fingers, or hold Shift with the arrow keys once the map has focus. The
needle on this button points north, and a click turns the map back north up and
flat. On a phone the compass floats at the top right of the map while the map is
turned or tilted, and the globe switch is in the Layers sheet. Replay keeps the
orientation you chose and points the airplane along its track on screen; Wrapped
shows its overview north up and flat and gives your view back when it closes.
While the map is already north up and flat the button is dimmed and does
nothing.

### Globe

Draw the map as a globe instead of in Mercator. From `z` 13 in the two look the
same, which is MapLibre's doing. Airport markers on the far side are hidden, and
a popup closes once the globe has turned its place away. The space around the
globe is the page background; no atmosphere is drawn.

### 3D

Lift the flights to their altitude, as ribbons about as wide as the lines at
every zoom that follow their climbs and descents in 20 ft steps close in (in
steps of no more than a pixel further out) and stand on the ground each flight
flew over: the build samples it under every logged position from an elevation
model (see [Elevation data](output.md#elevation-data)) and shifts it to meet the
altitudes the flight recorded taxiing at the field it left and at the one it
landed on, so a flight taxis on the map at both ends even where the model and
the recorder disagree by tens of feet, and crosses a ridge at its true height
above it. A flight whose ground is not known (a build with `--no-terrain` or
without the tiles) stands on a line from the one field to the other instead, and
an altitude glitch of the recorder takes no flight up with either.

Heights are exaggerated, and the relief under them as much, so a flight still
shows its shape on a map of half of Europe: 10 times at `z` 8 and further out, 7
at `z` 9, 4 at `z` 10 and twice from `z` 11 in.

Switching it on leaves the Heatmap, Altitude and Groundspeed layers as they are
(the heatmap is lifted as a cloud, the colour layers as ribbons), colours the
paths by altitude only when all three are off, where nothing would be lifted,
and tilts a flatter map to 50 degrees. Tilting the flat map does not turn it on;
the first time in a visit that you tilt it past 30 degrees yourself, a hint
offers the 3D view with a **3D** button (not while a replay, Wrapped or the
hotspot tour runs, nor once you switched 3D on or off). On a touch screen, where
a tilt is a small two-finger drag, 15 degrees are enough, and the same hint
comes once on the device without a tilt as well: the first time you zoom in by
hand past where the heat lines are drawn (`z` 12.75), as the map comes to rest,
or pick a single flight (not an airport's, nor one ticked in an airport's popup
or the phone's statistics sheet, which the hint would cover), whichever comes
first. That one goes by itself after eight seconds, or as soon as you move the
map, but not while the focus is on its buttons. The browser remembers that it
showed the hint, or that you switched 3D on or off yourself, in its
localStorage; where it cannot keep it, the hint comes once a visit. The hotspot
tour, which turns 3D on for its flight, or a link that opens in 3D leave the
hint for later. From `z` 18 in, where the camera is lower than a traffic
circuit, the flights are drawn flat again. Replay lifts its airplane and its
trail with them. The heatmap turns into a cloud of the flights at their heights
(see [Heatmap](#heatmap) above), on the relief and on the globe alike, and lies
flat from `z` 18 in with the flights.

At every zoom the map draws the relief under the flights, shaded faintly (dark
slopes, a little light on the others) over the satellite imagery when it is on
and under the labels and the flights, and each flight stands on it at its height
above the ground it flew over. Further out the map draws the relief from coarser
elevation tiles, and the ground under the flights is smoothed as much, so a
level flight stays level over the ridges to within about a pixel; the
exaggeration stops at 10 times since further out the Alps stood as a wall and a
flight over them sawed up and down. While a zoom goes on, and in the distance of
a tilted map, the map draws parts of the relief from the elevation tiles of
another level, and each flight stands on the ground of the level drawn under it,
so it stays level over the ridges there too. The exaggeration of the relief and
the flights changes as a zoom ends in another level, not during it, for both at
once, and the flights stay in sight. The relief comes from the same elevation
tiles as the ground (see [Elevation data](output.md#elevation-data)), which the
browser fetches from AWS while it is drawn. The globe only shades it: the relief
itself is left out there, and each flight stands on the line between its fields.

As the relief comes or goes, and as a zoom ends in another exaggeration while
the map still draws flights cut at `z` 7 or further out or at `z` 12 or further
in (after a zoom across more than one level from there, or another zoom before
those flights were drawn anew), the flights are hidden until they are drawn on
the new ground, for 3 seconds at most (a playing replay's trail, drawn anew in
every frame, is not waited for). Tilted past 45 degrees, the map leaves out the
place names of its far distance, which stood along the horizon over the fog.

### Heat cloud readout

In the 3D view, resting the pointer on the heat cloud, or tapping it on a phone,
shows a small box beside it with what the cloud there is made of: the time spent
within a round radius about as wide as the glow (from 100 m to 50 km, by zoom),
the number of flights that came that close, and the 400 ft band of height above
the ground most of it was in, for example "About 42 min within 1 km" over "17
flights · mostly 800 to 1,200 ft AGL". It is counted as the cloud counts it (the
seconds between the logged positions, at most two minutes each; a track without
times at a cruise), and never from the brightness, which the cloud scales to its
busiest places; it follows the filters and share mode, and says no date or time
of day.

There is none over the sky of a steeply tilted map, or beside the globe. In a
tilted view it counts every flight the line of sight through the pointer passes
near, at whatever height the cloud draws it, since the glow under the pointer
adds all of them up. Over a flight's ribbon its values show as well, and the box
goes beside them rather than over them, and clear of the panels over the map
where there is room; a tap on a flight shows both. Markers, airport codes and
dragging come first, and Escape puts the box away until the pointer moves on,
before it closes anything else. A click or a tap on the cloud is read out to
screen readers, unless it selected a flight, which is read out instead; a hover
is not. A click there never clears the selection. The flat heatmap has no
readout: its code comes with the 3D view, not with the first visit.

### Satellite

Draw the ground from satellite imagery (Sentinel-2 cloudless 2024 by EOX, see
[Satellite imagery](output.md#satellite-imagery)) instead of the dark map: over
its land and water, under its roads, borders and place names, the flights, the
heatmap and the Aviation overlay, which works over it too. The imagery is
darkened and made paler so the heat, the colour layers and the labels made for
the dark map still read. It is sharp to about `z` 14 and stretched further in,
where the roads and the Aviation layer show the airfields better. In the 3D view
it lies on the relief under the shading. Off on a first visit; kept in the link
and the saved session. The browser fetches the tiles from EOX only while it is
on, and the map credits them only then, in an exported image too. Should its
code fail to load, the switch turns back off and says so. On a phone it is in
the Layers sheet.

### Reset view

Go back to what a first visit shows: the newest year and all aircraft, the
heatmap and airports on and the other layers, 3D, the globe and the satellite
imagery off, nothing selected, the statistics closed, and the map flat and north
up over all the flights. The saved session and the link follow. While there is
nothing to reset, on a first visit and after a reset until the page or the map
changes, it is dimmed and a press does nothing. On a phone it is in the More
sheet; during a replay it is disabled like the filters.

### Across the controls

- A map attribution, on the map at every width; it steps aside only while a
  sheet or the statistics panel covers the map it credits. It wraps when the
  relief, the satellite imagery or the aviation layer add their credits; on a
  phone it shows two lines, and a tap on it shows the rest. There are no zoom
  buttons: use the scroll wheel, pinch, double click, or the keyboard once the
  map has focus
- A toggle that is off is drawn at full strength without the blue accent; only a
  control that cannot act right now (Replay without one timed flight selected,
  Share mode without a selection, North up and Reset view with nothing to reset,
  and what a replay disables, whose title then says to end the replay, the
  replay of all flights or the hotspot tour to change it) is dimmed. While
  Replay, Replay all or the hotspot tour runs, its control is drawn pressed with
  a filled stop square. A control that needs the flights says so with a toast
  while the first year still loads, rather than ignoring the click; a filter
  changed meanwhile is applied once it has loaded
- An error stays on screen until it is dismissed or put right (a later load of
  flights, of Replay's or Wrapped's code or of the satellite imagery, or the map
  drawing after all); a failed load offers Retry, which a running replay
  ignores. When the first year cannot be loaded the map says what failed and
  offers Retry there, with no toast beside it; the year dropdown keeps showing
  that year (or another one picked meanwhile that failed as well), which Retry
  loads again, the colour legends are hidden while there are no flights,
  Statistics, Wrapped, Replay all, the hotspot tour, the cross-section and the
  export are unavailable and say so (on a phone the tabs and the More rows too),
  and Reset view is available. The loading indicator shows from the start, while
  the list of years loads, and the year dropdown names the year the page opens
  on from the first paint
- The toasts stand over the colour legend beside the statistics or in a window
  narrower than 940 px: the legend steps aside there while one shows
- The controls come before the map in the tab order, and the "Skip to map" link
  at the start of the page goes past them to the map and its airport markers
- Below 768 px, or at 480 px of height and less (a phone held sideways), the two
  control columns are replaced by a bottom bar with five tabs. Layers, Filter
  and More open a sheet; Stats and Wrapped open their panel directly. A sheet
  closes with its close button, a tap beside it, or a drag down on its top edge
  (the grabber and the title) past a third of its height or a quick flick; a
  shorter drag lets it spring back, and under reduced motion it closes or
  returns at once. Escape closes an open sheet, and Tab stays inside it. The
  Layers sheet takes half the height, so the map above it shows what a switch
  did, and scrolls. Replay, Replay all and the hotspot tour take over the bottom
  edge and the bar steps aside until they end. The map shows no colour legend
  there, the heat's included; the Layers sheet shows the scales of altitude and
  groundspeed beside their switches
- Added to the home screen, the site opens as an app of its own (the manifest's
  `standalone` display), and on an iPhone the map fills the whole screen, under
  the status bar and around the Dynamic Island or the notch; the controls, the
  sheets, Wrapped, the popups, the map attribution and the first view keep clear
  of them, of the rounded corners and of the home indicator. In a Safari tab the
  strip at the top is Safari's own, and only a phone held sideways shows the map
  around the island

### Units

The page uses aviation units first, distances in nautical miles, groundspeeds in
knots and altitudes in feet, with the metric value beside them where there is
room. A flight's popup gives the altitude (MSL) in feet with metres after it and
the groundspeed in knots with km/h; the statistics rows give nautical miles with
kilometres, feet with metres and knots with km/h beside them; the replay readout
says feet and knots with metres and km/h; and the legends give both (see
[Altitude and Groundspeed](#altitude-and-groundspeed)). The Flights tab of the
statistics lists the distance in nautical miles and the highest altitude in feet
MSL, without the metric value. Distances on the ground are metric: a hotspot is
"18 km south-east of" its airport, the profile of a flight without times runs
over the kilometres flown, and the cross-section measures its corridor in metres
or kilometres either side and the distance along its line in kilometres, with
its heights in feet (AGL, MSL or above the field). Numbers are written the
American way on purpose, with a comma between the thousands ("264,400") and a
point before the decimals, whatever the browser's language, so every surface of
the page groups the digits the same way.

Escape closes the innermost thing first: the readout of the heat cloud, the
search while focus is in it (and the pulse of its last pick with it), then an
airport's popup while focus is on its marker or inside the popup (focus goes
back to the marker), then a sheet on a phone (the statistics sheet among them),
a replay, Replay all, the hotspot tour, Wrapped, the cross-section, whose Escape
takes back a point being placed or the line being redrawn before it closes the
tool, or the pulse the search left on the map. The popup of a flight or of a
replay has no Escape: its close button or a click on the map closes it.

## Filtering

- **Year filter** - View flights from specific years or all years combined
- **Aircraft filter** - Filter by aircraft registration to see flights per
  aircraft
- **Path selection** - Click paths to highlight and view detailed statistics. A
  mouse click on a flight selects it or takes it out. A tap shows the values of
  the flight with a Select (or Remove) button instead, so that looking at a
  flight on a phone does not change the selection; a touch laptop tells its
  mouse from its screen by each click. A click on the map beside every flight
  closes the popups and leaves the selection alone. A chip at the top of the map
  says how many flights are selected and clears them again (Clear), or puts them
  into share mode (Share); on a phone it also replays the selected flights, up
  to eight, when one of them has timing data, and while the statistics sheet is
  open it moves into the sheet's header without its count. With neither colour
  layer on, the selected flights are drawn as thin light lines over the heatmap,
  which steps back while they show, at every zoom level, and the lines are
  fainter the more flights are selected; in the 3D view they are lifted to their
  height with the heat cloud
- **Airport selection** - With nothing selected, click an airport marker to
  select all flights that visited it; with a selection, in share mode, or with a
  tap, the click only opens its popup, whose checkboxes select (a tap never
  changes the selection). The airport popup shows how the flights of the filter
  used its runways ("RWY 29 · 65%, RWY 11 · 35%") and lists those flights
  (route, aircraft and year), each a button that selects that one flight and a
  checkbox that adds it to the selection or takes it out, with Shift, Ctrl and
  share mode as in the flight list (the rows are marked as selected once the
  selection is not all of them, and a lone flight always), so a single flight
  and Replay are reachable from the keyboard: Tab to a marker, Enter opens the
  popup and moves focus into it, Escape closes it and returns focus to the
  marker
- **Year and aircraft filter with a selection** - A change of the filter keeps
  the selected flights it still shows and deselects the others, which a toast
  says: "1 selected flight is hidden by the filter and was deselected" for one
  the aircraft filter hides, "not in 2024" for one the year's flights lack (one
  year's file cannot tell another year's flight from one the site no longer has,
  and the metadata lists no flights). A dataset of every year leaves out a
  flight the site no longer has ("Left out 1 flight not on this site"). Share
  mode keeps every shared flight instead (see below), and its Exit deselects the
  ones the filter hides as a filter change does
- **Share mode** - For showing a few flights, the two or three of a day, to
  someone else: the map shows only the selected flights, and their heat alone,
  and the selection holds still. Turn it on with Share in the chip or Share mode
  in the Share group (More on a phone); the chip then says "Sharing 3 flights"
  and offers the link (Copy link) and Exit, which leaves the mode and keeps the
  flights selected. On a phone the chip shows share mode's mark and a blue
  border in place of "Sharing", and the link (Share link) and Exit as icons, so
  that it fits a 360 px screen beside Replay. While it is on, a click or a tap
  on a flight shows its values with a Remove button, a click on an airport opens
  its popup, and a click on a row of a list shows its flight, but none of them
  adds or removes a flight by itself; a flight joins or leaves with that Remove
  or its checkbox in a list, and the mode ends with Exit or the last flight. An
  airport whose last shared flight is unticked in its popup stays on the map
  until the popup closes. The shared flights are fixed under a change of the
  year or the aircraft as well: the ones the filter hides stay shared and in the
  link, and the chip says so ("Sharing 3 flights, 1 hidden by the filter", "3
  flights, 1 hidden" on a phone, "all hidden" where it hides every one, "1 not
  in 2024" or "none in 2024" for flights the year's file lacks, "1 not shown"
  for both). The map, its lines and ribbons, the airports, the statistics, the
  frame of Share, Replay and the altitude profile are of the shared flights the
  filter shows. A link opened in share mode shows the same flights the same way,
  with the same words for the others. Only a link to every year can tell a
  flight the site no longer has, which it leaves out and says so

## Shareable URLs

Map state is encoded in the URL for easy sharing. Copy the URL from your
browser's address bar or use the copy-link button:

- Specific year or all years (`?y=2025` or `?y=all`)
- Aircraft filter (`?a=D-EAGJ`)
- Selected paths (`?p=8vndgpro,1bspfs7g&sv=4`). A path id is derived from the
  flight's coordinates and altitudes, so a link keeps selecting the same flights
  after the site is regenerated with other flights added or removed; a flight
  that is no longer there is dropped from the selection. `sv` is the version of
  the id scheme. Version 4 writes the ids in base 36; version 3 links, which
  wrote the same ids in decimal (`?p=695806902132,104044549516&sv=3`), still
  work. Links written before version 3, when ids were positions in the export,
  lose their selection instead of selecting different flights
- Layer visibility (9 flags: heatmap, altitude, speed, airports, aviation,
  stats, wrapped, an unused legacy slot, isolateSelection). The 8th slot
  belonged to a control-visibility toggle that no longer exists; it is always
  written as `0` and not read, and kept so shared links still read their share
  mode flag from the 9th (once called Isolate, hence the name). The shorter
  strings of the releases before that flag (6 to 8 flags) are no longer read;
  such a link opens with the layers of a first visit. The slots and parameters
  of every toggle are listed in `kml_heatmap/frontend/state/toggles.ts`
  - Example: `?v=100100000`
- Map position (`?lat=51.5&lng=13.4&z=10`). A centre without `z` opens at
  zoom 10. `z` counts in 256 pixel tiles, as links always did, which is one more
  than MapLibre's own zoom for the same view; links shared before the switch to
  MapLibre therefore still show the same area
- Orientation (`?b=-40.5&t=35`): `b` is the bearing, the degrees the top of the
  map is turned clockwise from north (any number, wrapped into -180 to 180), and
  `t` the tilt in degrees (held between 0 and 85). Both are written to a tenth
  of a degree and left out while the map is north up and flat
- Globe (`?g=1`), left out for Mercator. A link without `b`, `t` and `g`, which
  is every link from before the map could turn, opens north up, flat and in
  Mercator
- 3D view (`?d=1`), left out while the flights are drawn flat
- Satellite imagery (`?s=1`), left out while the ground is the dark map. It is a
  parameter of its own, like `g` and `d`, so the nine flags of `v` and every
  older link stay as they were
- The Flights tab of the statistics panel (`?l=1`), left out while the panel
  shows its figures
- Debug logging in the browser console (`?debug=true`)
- The line of the cross-section (`?x=51.55,11.9,51.6,12.3`), the latitude and
  longitude of its start and then of its end, left out while the tool is closed;
  a link with it opens the tool on that line
- The heat counted by distance (`?r=1`) and the heat cloud's band of heights
  (`?h=500-3000`) are gone; an old link's `r` and `h` are ignored

Example URLs:

```text
?y=all                                   # Show all years
?y=2025&v=010000000                      # 2025 with the altitude layer only
?y=2025&a=D-EAGJ&lat=51.5&lng=13.4&z=10  # Complete state
?y=all&lat=48&lng=8&z=4&g=1&b=-30&t=50   # All years on a turned, tilted globe
?y=2025&z=9&t=60&d=1                     # 2025 in 3D
```

URL parameters take precedence over localStorage, allowing shared links to
override saved preferences.

## Smart features

- **Mid-flight detection** - A recording started in the air adds no departure
  airport, and an arrival is only added where the track ends in a landing
- **Airport deduplication** - Merges the entries of one ICAO code, and names
  without a code that lie within 1.5 km of a marker; two different ICAO codes
  stay separate however close they are. A code known to OurAirports places the
  marker at the airport's own coordinates, so every flight to it lands on the
  same marker
- **Airport names** - Standardized from the ICAO code ("EDDS Stuttgart"); a
  single-word name without a code is not shown or counted as an airport
- **Parallel processing** - Fast parsing and export of multiple files
- **State persistence** - Saves to localStorage and syncs with URL for shareable
  links
- **Year-based organization** - Extracts and organizes flights by year
- **Per-aircraft statistics** - Tracks flight time and distance per aircraft
  registration
- **Aircraft model lookup** - Resolves full aircraft model names from
  `aircraft.json`
