# Size budgets

What a visit downloads is held to budgets: the JavaScript bundles and the
vendored libraries in `build.js`, which every production build checks, and the
stylesheets in `tests/test_asset_budget.py`, which the Python tests check. This
page says what each budget covers, how a budget is raised and where its history
is kept. The numbers themselves live next to the budgets, in those two files.

## Bundles

A production build (`npm run build`) prints the size of every bundle next to its
budget, with the room it leaves in bytes, and fails when one of the bundles in
the table below exceeds its size budget in `build.js`; the last lines of a
failed build name each budget exceeded and by how many bytes. Each has a budget
for its bytes as written and one for them gzipped (level 9). CI's zlib
compresses up to about 0.5 % differently from a local build, so go by the
gzipped sizes CI prints when a budget is close.

| Budget in `build.js`   | What it covers                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BUDGET_APP`           | The first visit: `mapApp.bundle.js` and the `shared.bundle.js` it loads with it                  |
| `BUDGET_FEATURES`      | `features.bundle.js`: replay, the 3D view, the imagery, the profile, the cross-section, the tour |
| `BUDGET_WRAPPED`       | `wrapped.bundle.js`: Wrapped, the statistics panel and the flight list                           |
| `BUDGET_WORKER`        | `yearWorker.bundle.js`, preloaded in the page head and started with the first year file          |
| `BUDGET_MAPLIBRE`      | The vendored MapLibre GL JS modules and stylesheet, less the styles of controls the app lacks    |
| `BUDGET_HTML_TO_IMAGE` | The vendored html-to-image module, loaded on the first export                                    |

## Stylesheets

The stylesheets are minified by the Python side, not by `build.js`, so their
budgets are a test, `tests/test_asset_budget.py`, which fails in CI on a
regression and leaves the generator itself alone. `styles.css` is on the
critical path of every visit; `features.css` and `wrapped.css` are fetched with
their lazy bundles (see [Stylesheets](frontend.md#stylesheets)), so room taken
in them is not the same as room taken in `styles.css`, and each has a budget of
its own, for its bytes as the site serves it and one for them gzipped at level
9, as the bundles have.

## Raising a budget

The policy is written above the budgets in `build.js`:

- Raise a budget on purpose, in the change that needs the room, and say what it
  paid for in the commit message; the comment above the budget only says what it
  covers and how large that was when it was set
- An app bundle gets about 2 KB of raw and 1 KB of gzipped room over its size
  when the budget is set, a vendored file about 1 %
- The gzipped budget catches what the raw one rewards the wrong way: a change
  that saves raw bytes by making the code harder to compress
- Size a raise by the sizes CI prints (the "Build the JavaScript bundle" step of
  any job), not by a local build
- Two pull requests that each fit can still not fit together, since each is
  built against the main branch of its day; the budget is checked again on
  `main`
- A Dependabot bump of MapLibre that makes it noticeably larger fails the build;
  raise its budget in the pull request of the bump, with the new sizes
- The same goes for the stylesheets: raise a budget when a change needs the
  room, not to make the suite pass

## History

Every raise and lowering is in the history of its budget's line, with the sizes
before and after and what it paid for in the commit message:

```sh
git log -L '/^const BUDGET_FEATURES/,+1:build.js'
```

The stylesheets' budgets are kept the same way, in `tests/test_asset_budget.py`.
Where a change was sized against the budgets, its page says so as well, for
example
[the heat sources in the year worker](heat.md#the-heat-sources-and-the-year-worker)
and [the readout of the heat cloud](heat.md#no-readout-on-the-flat-map).
