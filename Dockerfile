# Install dependencies first so that source changes do not invalidate this
# layer. The build needs the runtime dependencies (vendored or bundled into
# the page, and the country flags scripts/vendor.js copies) and two of the
# development ones: esbuild, which runs it, and TypeScript, whose parser
# finds the shaders it tightens. The rest of the development tools
# (Playwright, Vitest, jsdom, ESLint) only test and lint, so the
# development dependencies are cut down to those two before installing.
# npm ci would refuse the edited package.json; npm install takes every
# version and integrity hash from the unchanged package-lock.json and
# --no-save leaves it as it is. A package build.js starts to import without
# being listed here fails the image build, not the site.
