/**
 * Visual regression for the page's own chrome.
 *
 * styles.css is over three thousand lines and nothing checked what it
 * renders: a rule that moved a control off screen or collapsed a panel
 * passed every functional test. These snapshots cover the parts a
 * stylesheet change is most likely to break, and deliberately not the map
 * itself, which is a canvas of live data.
 *
 * They run in their own project so the rest of the suite keeps working
 * wherever it is run; the snapshots are generated in the Playwright
 * container, which is also where CI compares them (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
 *
 * That project drives visual-site/, built from the fixture flights of
 * tests/fixtures/visual/ with a fixed build stamp, and not docs/: the rail
 * and Wrapped print figures computed from the flights, and every snapshot
 * here is compared without any tolerance. With 1% of the pixels allowed to
 * differ, which the flights of data/ needed, a missing control row passed
 * and so did three stale snapshots.
 *
 * The map itself is hidden rather than masked in the snapshots of the
 * chrome: a mask over a full-viewport element covers the chrome along with
 * it. One snapshot is of the map instead, the heat cloud of the 3D view,
 * whose own shaders nothing else compares (see the last describe).
